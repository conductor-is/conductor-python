    Specify a single full-name or multiple using a comma-separated list (e.g.,
    `fullNames=1,2,3`). Like `id`, a `fullName` is a unique identifier for a
    sales-tax code, and is formed by by combining the names of its parent objects
    with its own `name`, separated by colons. For example, if a sales-tax code is
    under "State" and has the `name` "CA Sales Tax", its `fullName` would be
    "State:CA Sales Tax". Unlike `name`, `fullName` is guaranteed to be unique
    across all sales-tax code objects.

    NOTE: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other query
    parameters.
