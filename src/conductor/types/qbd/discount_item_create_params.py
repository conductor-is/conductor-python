    The monetary amount to subtract from the total or subtotal when applying this
    discount item to a transaction.

    **NOTE**: A flat rate discount applies to ALL lines recorded above it and
    distributes the discount amount equally across those lines, which affects tax
    calculations. For example, a $10 discount applied to a $100 taxable item and
    $100 non-taxable item would result in a $5 taxable discount and $5 non-taxable
    discount.
