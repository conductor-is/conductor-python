    The current revision number of the non-inventory item object you are updating,

    setting this field to `true` in this scenario, the request will fail with an
    error; hence, this field is equivalent to accepting the warning prompt in the
    QuickBooks UI.

    NOTE: Changing the base unit requires you to update the item's
    quantities-on-hand and cost to reflect the new unit; otherwise, these values
    will be inaccurate. Alternatively, consider creating a new item with the desired
    unit-of-measure set and deactivating the old item.
