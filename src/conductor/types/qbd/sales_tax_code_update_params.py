    hierarchical objects, which is why `name` is unique for them but not for objects
    that have parents. Maximum length: 3 characters. This short name will appear on
    sales forms to identify the tax status of an item.

    agency. Unlike `salesTaxCode`, which only indicates general taxability, this
    field drives the actual tax calculation and reporting.
