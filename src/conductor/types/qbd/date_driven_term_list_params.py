    **IMPORTANT:**: QuickBooks Desktop does not support cursor-based pagination for
    date-driven terms. This parameter will limit the response size, but you cannot
    fetch subsequent results using a cursor. For pagination, use the name-range
    parameters instead (e.g., `nameFrom=A&nameTo=B`).

    When this parameter is omitted, the endpoint returns all date-driven terms
    without limit, unlike paginated endpoints which default to 150 records. This is
    acceptable because date-driven terms typically have low record counts.
