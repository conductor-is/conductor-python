    The pagination token to fetch the next set of results when paginating with the

    Specify a single full-name or multiple using a comma-separated list (e.g.,
    `fullNames=1,2,3`). Like `id`, a `fullName` is a unique identifier for an
    inventory item, and is formed by by combining the names of its parent objects
    with its own `name`, separated by colons. For example, if an inventory item is
    under "Furniture:Kitchen" and has the `name` "Cabinet", its `fullName` would be
    "Furniture:Kitchen:Cabinet". Unlike `name`, `fullName` is guaranteed to be
    unique across all inventory item objects. Not case-sensitive. NOTE: If you
