    field drives the actual tax calculation and reporting.

    For sales receipts, while using this field to specify a single tax item/group
    that applies uniformly is recommended, complex tax scenarios may require
    alternative approaches. In such cases, you can set this field to a 0% tax item
    (conventionally named "Tax Calculated On Invoice") and handle tax calculations
    through line items instead. When using line items for taxes, note that only
    individual tax items (not tax groups) can be used, subtotals can help apply a
