              currency in QuickBooks at the time of this transaction. Represented as a decimal

              **IMPORTANT**: Must be formatted as a valid GUID; otherwise, QuickBooks will
              return an error. This field is immutable and can only be set during object
              creation.

              items bundled together because they are commonly purchased together or grouped
              for faster entry.

          item_lines: The credit card charge's item lines, each representing the purchase of a
              specific item or service.

          memo: A memo or note for this credit card charge.

          payee_id: The vendor or company from whom merchandise or services were purchased for this

              transactions for this credit card charge. Default codes include "Non"

              a lexicographical comparison.

          ref_numbers: Filter for specific credit card charges by their ref-number(s), case-sensitive.
              In QuickBooks, ref-numbers are not required to be unique and can be arbitrarily
              changed by the QuickBooks user.

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          ref_number_starts_with: Filter for credit card charges whose `refNumber` starts with this substring.
              NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_to: Filter for credit card charges whose `refNumber` is less than or equal to this
              value. If omitted, the range will end with the last number of the list. Uses a
              numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.

          transaction_date_from: Filter for credit card charges created on or after this date, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD).

          transaction_date_to: Filter for credit card charges created on or before this date, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          updated_after: Filter for credit card charges updated on or after this date and time, in ISO
              8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the
              time is assumed to be 00:00:00 of that day.

          updated_before: Filter for credit card charges updated on or before this date and time, in ISO
              8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the

        Returns a list of credit card charges.

        Args:
          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          account_ids: Filter for credit card charges from these accounts.

          currency_ids: Filter for credit card charges in these currencies.

          cursor: The pagination token to fetch the next set of results when paginating with the
              `limit` parameter. Retrieve this value from the `nextCursor` field in the
              previous response. If omitted, the API returns the first page of results.

          ids: Filter for specific credit card charges by their QuickBooks-assigned unique
              identifier(s).

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          include_line_items: Whether to include line items in the response. Defaults to `true`.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return. Ranging from 1 to 150, defaults to 150.
              Use this parameter in conjunction with the `cursor` parameter to paginate
              through results. The response will include a `nextCursor` field, which can be
              used as the `cursor` parameter value in subsequent requests to fetch the next
              set of results.

          payee_ids: Filter for credit card charges to these payees. These are the vendors or
              companies from whom merchandise or services were purchased for these credit card
              charges.

          ref_number_contains:
              Filter for credit card charges whose `refNumber` contains this substring. NOTE:
              If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberStartsWith` or
              `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_ends_with:
              Filter for credit card charges whose `refNumber` ends with this substring. NOTE:
              If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberStartsWith`.

          ref_number_from: Filter for credit card charges whose `refNumber` is greater than or equal to
              this value. If omitted, the range will begin with the first number of the list.
              Uses a numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses
              a lexicographical comparison.

          ref_numbers: Filter for specific credit card charges by their ref-number(s), case-sensitive.
              In QuickBooks, ref-numbers are not required to be unique and can be arbitrarily
              changed by the QuickBooks user.

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          ref_number_starts_with: Filter for credit card charges whose `refNumber` starts with this substring.
              NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_to: Filter for credit card charges whose `refNumber` is less than or equal to this
              value. If omitted, the range will end with the last number of the list. Uses a
              numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.

          transaction_date_from: Filter for credit card charges created on or after this date, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD).

          transaction_date_to: Filter for credit card charges created on or before this date, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          updated_after: Filter for credit card charges updated on or after this date and time, in ISO
              8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the
              time is assumed to be 00:00:00 of that day.

          updated_before: Filter for credit card charges updated on or before this date and time, in ISO
              8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the
              time is assumed to be 23:59:59 of that day.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request

          timeout: Override the client-level default timeout for this request, in seconds
