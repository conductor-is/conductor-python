        Creates a new bill payment check.

        Args:
          apply_to_transactions: The bills to be paid by this bill payment check. This will create a link between
              this bill payment check and the specified bills.

              **IMPORTANT**: In each `applyToTransactions` object, you must specify either
              `paymentAmount`, `applyCredits`, `discountAmount`, or any combination of these;
              if none of these are specified, you will receive an error for an empty
              transaction.

              **IMPORTANT**: The target bill must have `isPaid=false`, otherwise, QuickBooks
              will report this object as "cannot be found".

          bank_account_id: The bank account from which the funds are being drawn for this bill payment
              check; e.g., Checking or Savings. This bill payment check will decrease the
              balance of this account.

          transaction_date: The date of this bill payment check, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          vendor_id: The vendor who sent the bill(s) that this check is paying and who will receive
              this payment.

              **IMPORTANT**: This vendor must match the `vendor` on the bill(s) specified in
              `applyToTransactions`; otherwise, QuickBooks will say the `transactionId` in
              `applyToTransactions` "does not exist".

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          exchange_rate: The market exchange rate between this bill payment check's currency and the home
              currency in QuickBooks at the time of this transaction. Represented as a decimal
              value (e.g., 1.2345 for 1 EUR = 1.2345 USD if USD is the home currency).

          external_id: A globally unique identifier (GUID) you can provide for tracking this object in
              your external system.

              **IMPORTANT**: Must be formatted as a valid GUID; otherwise, QuickBooks will
              return an error. This field is immutable and can only be set during object
              creation.

          is_queued_for_print: Indicates whether this bill payment check is included in the queue of documents
              for QuickBooks to print.

          memo: A memo or note for this bill payment check.

          payables_account_id: The Accounts-Payable (A/P) account to which this bill payment check is assigned,
              used to track the amount owed. If not specified, QuickBooks Desktop will use its
              default Accounts-Payable account.

              **IMPORTANT**: If this bill payment check is linked to other transactions, this
              A/P account must match the `payablesAccount` used in those other transactions.

          ref_number: The case-sensitive user-defined reference number for this bill payment check,
              which can be used to identify the transaction in QuickBooks. This value is not
              required to be unique and can be arbitrarily changed by the QuickBooks user.

              **IMPORTANT**: For checks, this field is the check number.

              this value. If omitted, the range will begin with the first number of the list.
              Uses a numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses
              a lexicographical comparison.

          ref_numbers: Filter for specific bill payment checks by their ref-number(s), case-sensitive.
              In QuickBooks, ref-numbers are not required to be unique and can be arbitrarily
              changed by the QuickBooks user.

              checks, this is the check number. NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot
              also use `refNumberContains` or `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_to: Filter for bill payment checks whose `refNumber` is less than or equal to this
              value. If omitted, the range will end with the last number of the list. Uses a
              numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.

          transaction_date_from: Filter for bill payment checks created on or after this date, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD).

          transaction_date_to: Filter for bill payment checks created on or before this date, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          updated_after: Filter for bill payment checks updated on or after this date and time, in ISO
              8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the
              time is assumed to be 00:00:00 of that day.

        Creates a new bill payment check.

        Args:
          apply_to_transactions: The bills to be paid by this bill payment check. This will create a link between
              this bill payment check and the specified bills.

              **IMPORTANT**: In each `applyToTransactions` object, you must specify either
              `paymentAmount`, `applyCredits`, `discountAmount`, or any combination of these;
              if none of these are specified, you will receive an error for an empty
              transaction.

              **IMPORTANT**: The target bill must have `isPaid=false`, otherwise, QuickBooks
              will report this object as "cannot be found".

          bank_account_id: The bank account from which the funds are being drawn for this bill payment
              check; e.g., Checking or Savings. This bill payment check will decrease the
              balance of this account.

          transaction_date: The date of this bill payment check, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          vendor_id: The vendor who sent the bill(s) that this check is paying and who will receive
              this payment.

              **IMPORTANT**: This vendor must match the `vendor` on the bill(s) specified in
              `applyToTransactions`; otherwise, QuickBooks will say the `transactionId` in
              `applyToTransactions` "does not exist".

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          exchange_rate: The market exchange rate between this bill payment check's currency and the home
              currency in QuickBooks at the time of this transaction. Represented as a decimal
              value (e.g., 1.2345 for 1 EUR = 1.2345 USD if USD is the home currency).

          external_id: A globally unique identifier (GUID) you can provide for tracking this object in
              your external system.

              **IMPORTANT**: Must be formatted as a valid GUID; otherwise, QuickBooks will
              return an error. This field is immutable and can only be set during object
              creation.

          is_queued_for_print: Indicates whether this bill payment check is included in the queue of documents
              for QuickBooks to print.

          memo: A memo or note for this bill payment check.

          payables_account_id: The Accounts-Payable (A/P) account to which this bill payment check is assigned,
              used to track the amount owed. If not specified, QuickBooks Desktop will use its
              default Accounts-Payable account.

              **IMPORTANT**: If this bill payment check is linked to other transactions, this
              A/P account must match the `payablesAccount` used in those other transactions.

          ref_number: The case-sensitive user-defined reference number for this bill payment check,
              which can be used to identify the transaction in QuickBooks. This value is not
              required to be unique and can be arbitrarily changed by the QuickBooks user.

          cursor: The pagination token to fetch the next set of results when paginating with the
              `limit` parameter. Retrieve this value from the `nextCursor` field in the
              previous response. If omitted, the API returns the first page of results.

              set of results.

          ref_number_contains: Filter for bill payment checks whose `refNumber` contains this substring. For
              checks, this is the check number. NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot
              also use `refNumberStartsWith` or `refNumberEndsWith`.

              also use `refNumberContains` or `refNumberStartsWith`.

          ref_number_from: Filter for bill payment checks whose `refNumber` is greater than or equal to
              this value. If omitted, the range will begin with the first number of the list.
              Uses a numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses
              a lexicographical comparison.

          ref_numbers: Filter for specific bill payment checks by their ref-number(s), case-sensitive.
              In QuickBooks, ref-numbers are not required to be unique and can be arbitrarily
              changed by the QuickBooks user.

              checks, this is the check number. NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot
              also use `refNumberContains` or `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_to: Filter for bill payment checks whose `refNumber` is less than or equal to this
              value. If omitted, the range will end with the last number of the list. Uses a
              numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.

          transaction_date_from: Filter for bill payment checks created on or after this date, in ISO 8601 format
