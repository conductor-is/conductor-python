        Creates a new discount item.

        Args:
          account_id: The posting account to which transactions involving this discount item are
              posted for tracking discounts.

          name: The case-insensitive name of this discount item. Not guaranteed to be unique
              because it does not include the names of its hierarchical parent objects like
              `fullName` does. For example, two discount items could both have the `name` "10%
              labor discount", but they could have unique `fullName` values, such as
              "Discounts:10% labor discount" and "Promotions:10% labor discount".

              Maximum length: 31 characters.

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          barcode: The discount item's barcode.

          class_id: The discount item's class. Classes can be used to categorize objects into
              meaningful segments, such as department, location, or type of work. In
              QuickBooks, class tracking is off by default.

          description: The discount item's description that will appear on sales forms that include
              this item.

          discount_rate: The monetary amount to subtract from the total or subtotal when applying this
              discount item to a transaction.

              **NOTE**: A flat rate discount applies to ALL lines recorded above it and
              distributes the discount amount equally across those lines, which affects tax
              calculations. For example, a $10 discount applied to a $100 taxable item and
              $100 non-taxable item would result in a $5 taxable discount and $5 non-taxable
              discount.

          discount_rate_percent: The percentage amount to subtract from the total or subtotal when applying this
              discount item to a transaction.

              **NOTE**: A percentage discount only applies to the line immediately above it,
              so tax implications only affect that specific line.

          external_id: A globally unique identifier (GUID) you, the developer, can provide for tracking
              this object in your external system. This field is immutable and can only be set
              during object creation.

              **IMPORTANT**: This field must be formatted as a valid GUID; otherwise,
              QuickBooks will return an error.

          is_active: Indicates whether this discount item is active. Inactive objects are typically
              hidden from views and reports in QuickBooks. Defaults to `true`.

          parent_id: The parent discount item one level above this one in the hierarchy. For example,
              if this discount item has a `fullName` of "Discounts:10% labor discount", its
              parent has a `fullName` of "Discounts". If this discount item is at the top
              level, this field will be `null`.

          sales_tax_code_id: The default sales-tax code for this discount item, determining whether it is
              taxable or non-taxable. This can be overridden at the transaction-line level.

              Default codes include "Non" (non-taxable) and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes
              can also be created in QuickBooks. If QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales
              tax (via the "Do You Charge Sales Tax?" preference), it will assign the default
              non-taxable code to all sales.

          class_ids: Filter for discount items of these classes. A class is a way end-users can
              categorize discount items in QuickBooks.

          cursor: The pagination token to fetch the next set of results when paginating with the
              `limit` parameter. Do not include this parameter on the first call. Use the
              `nextCursor` value returned in the previous response to request subsequent
              results.

          full_names: Filter for specific discount items by their full-name(s), case-insensitive. Like
              `id`, `fullName` is a unique identifier for a discount item, formed by by

              "10% labor discount", its `fullName` would be "Discounts:10% labor discount".

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          ids: Filter for specific discount items by their QuickBooks-assigned unique
              identifier(s).

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return. Accepts values ranging from 1 to 150,
              defaults to 150. When used with cursor-based pagination, this parameter controls
              how many results are returned per page. To paginate through results, combine
              this with the `cursor` parameter. Each response will include a `nextCursor`
              value that can be passed to subsequent requests to retrieve the next page of
              results.

          name_contains: Filter for discount items whose `name` contains this substring,

          name_from: Filter for discount items whose `name` is alphabetically greater than or equal
              to this value.

          name_starts_with: Filter for discount items whose `name` starts with this substring,
              case-insensitive. NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use
              `nameContains` or `nameEndsWith`.

          name_to: Filter for discount items whose `name` is alphabetically less than or equal to
              this value.

              posted for tracking discounts.

          name: The case-insensitive name of this discount item. Not guaranteed to be unique
              because it does not include the names of its hierarchical parent objects like
              `fullName` does. For example, two discount items could both have the `name` "10%
              labor discount", but they could have unique `fullName` values, such as
              "Discounts:10% labor discount" and "Promotions:10% labor discount".

              Maximum length: 31 characters.

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          barcode: The discount item's barcode.

          class_id: The discount item's class. Classes can be used to categorize objects into
              meaningful segments, such as department, location, or type of work. In
              QuickBooks, class tracking is off by default.

          description: The discount item's description that will appear on sales forms that include
              this item.

          discount_rate: The monetary amount to subtract from the total or subtotal when applying this
              discount item to a transaction.

              **NOTE**: A flat rate discount applies to ALL lines recorded above it and
              distributes the discount amount equally across those lines, which affects tax
              calculations. For example, a $10 discount applied to a $100 taxable item and
              $100 non-taxable item would result in a $5 taxable discount and $5 non-taxable
              discount.

          discount_rate_percent: The percentage amount to subtract from the total or subtotal when applying this
              discount item to a transaction.

              **NOTE**: A percentage discount only applies to the line immediately above it,
              so tax implications only affect that specific line.

          external_id: A globally unique identifier (GUID) you, the developer, can provide for tracking
              this object in your external system. This field is immutable and can only be set
              during object creation.

              **IMPORTANT**: This field must be formatted as a valid GUID; otherwise,
              QuickBooks will return an error.

          is_active: Indicates whether this discount item is active. Inactive objects are typically
              hidden from views and reports in QuickBooks. Defaults to `true`.

          parent_id: The parent discount item one level above this one in the hierarchy. For example,
              if this discount item has a `fullName` of "Discounts:10% labor discount", its
              parent has a `fullName` of "Discounts". If this discount item is at the top
              level, this field will be `null`.

          sales_tax_code_id: The default sales-tax code for this discount item, determining whether it is
              taxable or non-taxable. This can be overridden at the transaction-line level.

              Default codes include "Non" (non-taxable) and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes
              can also be created in QuickBooks. If QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales
              tax (via the "Do You Charge Sales Tax?" preference), it will assign the default
              non-taxable code to all sales.

              `id`, `fullName` is a unique identifier for a discount item, formed by by
              combining the names of its parent objects with its own `name`, separated by
              colons. For example, if a discount item is under "Discounts" and has the `name`
              "10% labor discount", its `fullName` would be "Discounts:10% labor discount".

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          ids: Filter for specific discount items by their QuickBooks-assigned unique
              identifier(s).

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return. Accepts values ranging from 1 to 150,
              defaults to 150. When used with cursor-based pagination, this parameter controls
              how many results are returned per page. To paginate through results, combine
              this with the `cursor` parameter. Each response will include a `nextCursor`
              value that can be passed to subsequent requests to retrieve the next page of
              results.

          name_contains: Filter for discount items whose `name` contains this substring,
              case-insensitive. NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use
              `nameStartsWith` or `nameEndsWith`.

          name_ends_with: Filter for discount items whose `name` ends with this substring,
              case-insensitive. NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use
              `nameContains` or `nameStartsWith`.

          name_from: Filter for discount items whose `name` is alphabetically greater than or equal
              to this value.

          name_starts_with: Filter for discount items whose `name` starts with this substring,
              case-insensitive. NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use
              `nameContains` or `nameEndsWith`.

          name_to: Filter for discount items whose `name` is alphabetically less than or equal to
              this value.

          status: Filter for discount items that are active, inactive, or both.

          updated_after: Filter for discount items updated on or after this date and time, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time
              is assumed to be 00:00:00 of that day.

          updated_before: Filter for discount items updated on or before this date and time, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time
              is assumed to be 23:59:59 of that day.
