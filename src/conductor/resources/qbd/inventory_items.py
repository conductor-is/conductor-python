        Creates a new inventory item.

        Args:
          asset_account_id: The asset account used to track the current value of this inventory item in
              inventory.

          cogs_account_id: The Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) account for this inventory item, tracking the
              original direct costs of producing goods sold.

          income_account_id: The income account used to track revenue from sales of this inventory item.

          name: The case-insensitive name of this inventory item. Not guaranteed to be unique
              because it does not include the names of its hierarchical parent objects like
              `fullName` does. For example, two inventory items could both have the `name`
              "Cabinet", but they could have unique `fullName` values, such as
              "Kitchen:Cabinet" and "Inventory:Cabinet". Maximum length: 31 characters.

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          barcode: The inventory item's barcode.

          class_id: The inventory item's class. Classes can be used to categorize objects into
              meaningful segments, such as department, location, or type of work. In
              QuickBooks, class tracking is off by default.

          external_id: A globally unique identifier (GUID) you can provide for tracking this object in
              your external system.

              **IMPORTANT**: Must be formatted as a valid GUID; otherwise, QuickBooks will
              return an error. This field is immutable and can only be set during object
              creation.

          inventory_date: The date when this inventory item was converted into an inventory item from some
              other type of item, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          is_active: Indicates whether this inventory item is active. Inactive objects are typically
              hidden from views and reports in QuickBooks.

          maximum_quantity_on_hand: The maximum quantity of this inventory item desired in inventory.

          parent_id: The parent inventory item one level above this one in the hierarchy. For
              example, if this inventory item has a `fullName` of "Kitchen:Cabinet", its
              parent has a `fullName` of "Kitchen". If this inventory item is at the top
              level, this field will be `null`.

          preferred_vendor_id: The preferred vendor from whom this inventory item is typically purchased.

          purchase_cost: The cost at which this inventory item is purchased from vendors, represented as
              a decimal string.

          purchase_description: The description of this inventory item that appears on purchase forms (e.g.,
              checks, bills, item receipts) when it is ordered or bought from vendors.

          purchase_tax_code_id: The tax code applied to purchases of this inventory item. Applicable in regions
              where purchase taxes are used, such as Canada or the UK.

          quantity_on_hand: The current quantity of this inventory item available in inventory. To change
              the `quantityOnHand` for an inventory item, you must create an
              inventory-adjustment instead of updating this inventory item directly.

          reorder_point: The minimum quantity of this inventory item at which QuickBooks prompts for
              reordering.

          sales_description: The description of this inventory item that appears on sales forms (e.g.,
              invoices, sales receipts) when sold to customers.

          sales_price: The price at which this inventory item is sold to customers, represented as a
              decimal string.

          sales_tax_code_id: The sales-tax code associated with this inventory item, determining whether it
              is taxable or non-taxable. It's used to assign a default tax status to all
              transactions for this inventory item. Default codes include "Non" (non-taxable)
              and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes can also be created in QuickBooks. If
              QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales tax (via the "Do You Charge Sales Tax?"
              preference), it will assign the default non-taxable code to all sales.

          sku: The inventory item's stock keeping unit (SKU), which is sometimes the
              manufacturer's part number.

          total_value: The total value of this inventory item. If `totalValue` is provided,
              `quantityOnHand` must also be provided and must be greater than zero. If both
              `quantityOnHand` and `purchaseCost` are provided, then `totalValue` will be set
              to `quantityOnHand` times `purchaseCost`, regardless of what `totalValue` is
              explicitly set to.

          unit_of_measure_set_id: The unit-of-measure set associated with this inventory item, which consists of a
              base unit and related units.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

        Returns a list of inventory items.

        Args:
          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          class_ids: Filter for inventory items of these classes. A class is a way end-users can
              categorize inventory items in QuickBooks.

          cursor: The pagination token to fetch the next set of results when paginating with the
              `limit` parameter. Retrieve this value from the `nextCursor` field in the
              previous response. If omitted, the API returns the first page of results.

          full_names: Filter for specific inventory items by their full-name(s), case-insensitive.
              Like `id`, `fullName` is a unique identifier for an inventory item, formed by by
              combining the names of its parent objects with its own `name`, separated by
              colons. For example, if an inventory item is under "Kitchen" and has the `name`
              "Cabinet", its `fullName` would be "Kitchen:Cabinet".

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          ids: Filter for specific inventory items by their QuickBooks-assigned unique
              identifier(s).

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return. Ranging from 1 to 150, defaults to 150.
              Use this parameter in conjunction with the `cursor` parameter to paginate
              through results. The response will include a `nextCursor` field, which can be
              used as the `cursor` parameter value in subsequent requests to fetch the next
              set of results.

          name_contains: Filter for inventory items whose `name` contains this substring,
              case-insensitive. NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use
              `nameStartsWith` or `nameEndsWith`.

          name_ends_with: Filter for inventory items whose `name` ends with this substring,
              case-insensitive. NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use
              `nameContains` or `nameStartsWith`.

          name_from: Filter for inventory items whose `name` is alphabetically greater than or equal
              to this value.

          name_starts_with: Filter for inventory items whose `name` starts with this substring,
              case-insensitive. NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use
              `nameContains` or `nameEndsWith`.

          name_to: Filter for inventory items whose `name` is alphabetically less than or equal to
              this value.

          status: Filter for inventory items that are active, inactive, or both.

          updated_after: Filter for inventory items updated on or after this date and time, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time
              is assumed to be 00:00:00 of that day.

              **WARNING**: Due to a known issue in QuickBooks Desktop, the `updatedAfter`
              parameter may not correctly filter inventory items by their updated dates. To
              accurately retrieve the desired inventory items, we recommend avoiding this
              parameter and instead fetching a broader dataset, then filtering the results
              locally using the `updatedAt` property.

          updated_before: Filter for inventory items updated on or before this date and time, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time
              is assumed to be 23:59:59 of that day.

              **WARNING**: Due to a known issue in QuickBooks Desktop, the `updatedBefore`
              parameter may not correctly filter inventory items by their updated dates. To
              accurately retrieve the desired inventory items, we recommend avoiding this
              parameter and instead fetching a broader dataset, then filtering the results
              locally using the `updatedAt` property.

        Args:
          asset_account_id: The asset account used to track the current value of this inventory item in
              inventory.

          cogs_account_id: The Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) account for this inventory item, tracking the
              original direct costs of producing goods sold.

          income_account_id: The income account used to track revenue from sales of this inventory item.

          name: The case-insensitive name of this inventory item. Not guaranteed to be unique
              because it does not include the names of its hierarchical parent objects like
              `fullName` does. For example, two inventory items could both have the `name`
              "Cabinet", but they could have unique `fullName` values, such as
              "Kitchen:Cabinet" and "Inventory:Cabinet". Maximum length: 31 characters.

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          barcode: The inventory item's barcode.

          class_id: The inventory item's class. Classes can be used to categorize objects into
              meaningful segments, such as department, location, or type of work. In
              QuickBooks, class tracking is off by default.

          external_id: A globally unique identifier (GUID) you can provide for tracking this object in
              your external system.

              **IMPORTANT**: Must be formatted as a valid GUID; otherwise, QuickBooks will
              return an error. This field is immutable and can only be set during object
              creation.

          inventory_date: The date when this inventory item was converted into an inventory item from some
              other type of item, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          is_active: Indicates whether this inventory item is active. Inactive objects are typically
              hidden from views and reports in QuickBooks.

          maximum_quantity_on_hand: The maximum quantity of this inventory item desired in inventory.

          parent_id: The parent inventory item one level above this one in the hierarchy. For
              example, if this inventory item has a `fullName` of "Kitchen:Cabinet", its
              parent has a `fullName` of "Kitchen". If this inventory item is at the top
              level, this field will be `null`.

          preferred_vendor_id: The preferred vendor from whom this inventory item is typically purchased.

          purchase_cost: The cost at which this inventory item is purchased from vendors, represented as
              a decimal string.

          purchase_description: The description of this inventory item that appears on purchase forms (e.g.,
              checks, bills, item receipts) when it is ordered or bought from vendors.

          purchase_tax_code_id: The tax code applied to purchases of this inventory item. Applicable in regions
              where purchase taxes are used, such as Canada or the UK.

          quantity_on_hand: The current quantity of this inventory item available in inventory. To change
              the `quantityOnHand` for an inventory item, you must create an
              inventory-adjustment instead of updating this inventory item directly.

          reorder_point: The minimum quantity of this inventory item at which QuickBooks prompts for
              reordering.

          sales_description: The description of this inventory item that appears on sales forms (e.g.,
              invoices, sales receipts) when sold to customers.

          sales_price: The price at which this inventory item is sold to customers, represented as a
              decimal string.

          sales_tax_code_id: The sales-tax code associated with this inventory item, determining whether it
              is taxable or non-taxable. It's used to assign a default tax status to all
              transactions for this inventory item. Default codes include "Non" (non-taxable)
              and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes can also be created in QuickBooks. If
              QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales tax (via the "Do You Charge Sales Tax?"
              preference), it will assign the default non-taxable code to all sales.

          sku: The inventory item's stock keeping unit (SKU), which is sometimes the
              manufacturer's part number.

          total_value: The total value of this inventory item. If `totalValue` is provided,
              `quantityOnHand` must also be provided and must be greater than zero. If both
              `quantityOnHand` and `purchaseCost` are provided, then `totalValue` will be set
              to `quantityOnHand` times `purchaseCost`, regardless of what `totalValue` is
              explicitly set to.

          unit_of_measure_set_id: The unit-of-measure set associated with this inventory item, which consists of a
              base unit and related units.

        Updates an existing inventory item.

        Args:
          id: The QuickBooks-assigned unique identifier of the inventory item to update.

          revision_number: The current revision number of the inventory item object you are updating, which
              you can get by fetching the object first. Provide the most recent
              `revisionNumber` to ensure you're working with the latest data; otherwise, the
              update will return an error.

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          asset_account_id: The asset account used to track the current value of this inventory item in
              inventory.

          barcode: The inventory item's barcode.

          class_id: The inventory item's class. Classes can be used to categorize objects into
              meaningful segments, such as department, location, or type of work. In
              QuickBooks, class tracking is off by default.

          cogs_account_id: The Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) account for this inventory item, tracking the
              original direct costs of producing goods sold.

          force_unit_of_measure_change: Indicates whether to allow changing the inventory item's unit-of-measure set
              (using the `unitOfMeasureSetId` field) when the base unit of the new
              unit-of-measure set does not match that of the currently assigned set. Without
              setting this field to `true` in this scenario, the request will fail with an
              error; hence, this field is equivalent to accepting the warning prompt in the
              QuickBooks UI.

              NOTE: Changing the base unit requires you to update the item's
              quantities-on-hand and cost to reflect the new unit; otherwise, these values
              will be inaccurate. Alternatively, consider creating a new item with the desired
              unit-of-measure set and deactivating the old item.

          income_account_id: The income account used to track revenue from sales of this inventory item.

          is_active: Indicates whether this inventory item is active. Inactive objects are typically
              hidden from views and reports in QuickBooks.

          maximum_quantity_on_hand: The maximum quantity of this inventory item desired in inventory.

          name: The case-insensitive name of this inventory item. Not guaranteed to be unique
              because it does not include the names of its hierarchical parent objects like
              `fullName` does. For example, two inventory items could both have the `name`
              "Cabinet", but they could have unique `fullName` values, such as
              "Kitchen:Cabinet" and "Inventory:Cabinet". Maximum length: 31 characters.

          parent_id: The parent inventory item one level above this one in the hierarchy. For
              example, if this inventory item has a `fullName` of "Kitchen:Cabinet", its
              parent has a `fullName` of "Kitchen". If this inventory item is at the top
              level, this field will be `null`.

          preferred_vendor_id: The preferred vendor from whom this inventory item is typically purchased.

          purchase_cost: The cost at which this inventory item is purchased from vendors, represented as
              a decimal string.

          purchase_description: The description of this inventory item that appears on purchase forms (e.g.,
              checks, bills, item receipts) when it is ordered or bought from vendors.

          purchase_tax_code_id: The tax code applied to purchases of this inventory item. Applicable in regions
              where purchase taxes are used, such as Canada or the UK.

          reorder_point: The minimum quantity of this inventory item at which QuickBooks prompts for
              reordering.

          sales_description: The description of this inventory item that appears on sales forms (e.g.,
              invoices, sales receipts) when sold to customers.

          sales_price: The price at which this inventory item is sold to customers, represented as a
              decimal string.

          sales_tax_code_id: The sales-tax code associated with this inventory item, determining whether it
              is taxable or non-taxable. It's used to assign a default tax status to all
              transactions for this inventory item. Default codes include "Non" (non-taxable)
              and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes can also be created in QuickBooks. If
              QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales tax (via the "Do You Charge Sales Tax?"
              preference), it will assign the default non-taxable code to all sales.

          sku: The inventory item's stock keeping unit (SKU), which is sometimes the
              manufacturer's part number.

          unit_of_measure_set_id: The unit-of-measure set associated with this inventory item, which consists of a
              base unit and related units.

          update_existing_transactions_cogs_account: When `true`, applies the new COGS account (specified by the `cogsAccountId`
              field) to all existing transactions that use this inventory item. If `true`, the
              COGS account will be updated in all historical transactions where this inventory
              item appears. Be cautious with this setting as it modifies historical data. The
              update will fail if any affected transactions fall within a closed accounting
              period. If not specified, QuickBooks will prompt the user to make this choice.

          update_existing_transactions_income_account: When `true`, applies the new income account (specified by the `incomeAccountId`
              field) to all existing transactions that use this inventory item. If `true`, the
              income account will be updated in all historical transactions where this
              inventory item appears. Be cautious with this setting as it modifies historical
              data. The update will fail if any affected transactions fall within a closed
              accounting period. If not specified, QuickBooks will prompt the user to make
              this choice.

              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          class_ids: Filter for inventory items of these classes. A class is a way end-users can
              categorize inventory items in QuickBooks.

          cursor: The pagination token to fetch the next set of results when paginating with the
              `limit` parameter. Retrieve this value from the `nextCursor` field in the
              previous response. If omitted, the API returns the first page of results.

          full_names: Filter for specific inventory items by their full-name(s), case-insensitive.
              Like `id`, `fullName` is a unique identifier for an inventory item, formed by by
              combining the names of its parent objects with its own `name`, separated by
              colons. For example, if an inventory item is under "Kitchen" and has the `name`
              "Cabinet", its `fullName` would be "Kitchen:Cabinet".

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          ids: Filter for specific inventory items by their QuickBooks-assigned unique
              identifier(s).

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return. Ranging from 1 to 150, defaults to 150.
              Use this parameter in conjunction with the `cursor` parameter to paginate
              through results. The response will include a `nextCursor` field, which can be
              used as the `cursor` parameter value in subsequent requests to fetch the next
              set of results.

          name_contains: Filter for inventory items whose `name` contains this substring,
              case-insensitive. NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use
              `nameStartsWith` or `nameEndsWith`.

          name_ends_with: Filter for inventory items whose `name` ends with this substring,
              case-insensitive. NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use
              `nameContains` or `nameStartsWith`.

          name_from: Filter for inventory items whose `name` is alphabetically greater than or equal
              to this value.

          name_starts_with: Filter for inventory items whose `name` starts with this substring,
              case-insensitive. NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use
              `nameContains` or `nameEndsWith`.

          name_to: Filter for inventory items whose `name` is alphabetically less than or equal to
              this value.

          status: Filter for inventory items that are active, inactive, or both.

          updated_after: Filter for inventory items updated on or after this date and time, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time
              is assumed to be 00:00:00 of that day.

              **WARNING**: Due to a known issue in QuickBooks Desktop, the `updatedAfter`
              parameter may not correctly filter inventory items by their updated dates. To
              accurately retrieve the desired inventory items, we recommend avoiding this
              parameter and instead fetching a broader dataset, then filtering the results
              locally using the `updatedAt` property.

          updated_before: Filter for inventory items updated on or before this date and time, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time
              is assumed to be 23:59:59 of that day.

              **WARNING**: Due to a known issue in QuickBooks Desktop, the `updatedBefore`
              parameter may not correctly filter inventory items by their updated dates. To
