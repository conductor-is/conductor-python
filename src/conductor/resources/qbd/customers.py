        Creates a new customer.

        Args:
          name: The case-insensitive name of this customer. Not guaranteed to be unique because
              it does not include the names of its hierarchical parent objects like `fullName`
              does. For example, two customers could both have the `name` "Website Redesign
              Project", but they could have unique `fullName` values, such as "ABC
              Corporation:Website Redesign Project" and "Baker:Website Redesign Project".
              Maximum length: 41 characters.

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          account_number: The customer's account number, which appears in the QuickBooks chart of
              accounts, reports, and graphs. Note that if the "Use Account Numbers" preference
              is turned off in QuickBooks, the account number may not be visible in the user
              interface, but it can still be set and retrieved through the API.

          additional_contacts: Additional alternate contacts for this customer.

          additional_notes: Additional notes about this customer.

          alternate_contact: The name of a alternate contact person for this customer.

          alternate_phone: The customer's alternate telephone number.

          alternate_shipping_addresses: A list of additional shipping addresses for this customer. Useful when the
              customer has multiple shipping locations.

          billing_address: The customer's billing address.

          cc_email: An email address to carbon copy (CC) on communications with this customer.

          class_id: The customer's class. Classes can be used to categorize objects into meaningful
              segments, such as department, location, or type of work. In QuickBooks, class
              tracking is off by default.

          company_name: The name of the company associated with this customer. This name is used on
              invoices, checks, and other forms.

          contact: The name of the primary contact person for this customer.

          credit_card: The customer's credit card information, including card type, number, and
              expiration date, used for processing credit card payments.

          credit_limit: The customer's credit limit, represented as a decimal string. This is the
              maximum amount of money this customer can spend before being billed. If `null`,
              there is no credit limit.

          currency_id: The customer's currency. For built-in currencies, the name and code are standard
              international values. For user-defined currencies, all values are editable.

          custom_contact_fields: Additional custom contact fields for this customer, such as phone numbers or
              email addresses.

          customer_type_id: The customer's type, used for categorizing customers into meaningful segments,
              such as industry or region.

          email: The customer's email address.

          external_id: A globally unique identifier (GUID) you can provide for tracking this object in
              your external system.

              **IMPORTANT**: Must be formatted as a valid GUID; otherwise, QuickBooks will
              return an error. This field is immutable and can only be set during object
              creation.

          fax: The customer's fax number.

          first_name: The first name of the contact person for this customer.

          is_active: Indicates whether this customer is active. Inactive objects are typically hidden
              from views and reports in QuickBooks.

          job_description: A brief description of this customer's job, if this object is a job (i.e.,
              sub-customer).

          job_end_date: The actual completion date of this customer's job, if applicable, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          job_projected_end_date: The projected completion date for this customer's job, if applicable, in ISO
              8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          job_start_date: The date when work on this customer's job began, if applicable, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          job_status: The status of this customer's job, if this object is a job (i.e., sub-customer).

          job_title: The job title of the contact person for this customer.

          job_type_id: The type or category of this customer's job, if this object is a job (i.e.,
              sub-customer). Useful for classifying into meaningful segments (e.g., repair,
              installation, consulting).

          last_name: The last name of the contact person for this customer.

          middle_name: The middle name of the contact person for this customer.

          note: Additional notes or comments about this customer.

          opening_balance: The opening balance of this customer's account, indicating the amount owed by
              this customer, represented as a decimal string.

          opening_balance_date: The date of the opening balance of this customer, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD).

          parent_id: The parent customer one level above this one in the hierarchy. For example, if
              this customer has a `fullName` of "ABC Corporation:Website Redesign Project",
              its parent has a `fullName` of "ABC Corporation". If this customer is at the top
              level, this field will be `null`.

          phone: The customer's primary telephone number.

          preferred_delivery_method: The preferred method for delivering invoices and other documents to this
              customer.

          preferred_payment_method_id: The customer's preferred payment method (e.g., cash, check, credit card).

          price_level_id: The customer's custom price level that QuickBooks automatically applies to
              calculate item rates in new transactions (e.g., invoices, sales receipts, sales
              orders, and credit memos) for this customer. While applied automatically, this
              can be overridden when creating individual transactions. Note that transactions
              will not show the price level itself, only the final `rate` calculated from it.

          resale_number: The customer's resale number, used if the customer is purchasing items for
              resale. This number does not affect sales tax calculations or reports in
              QuickBooks.

          sales_representative_id: The customer's sales representative. Sales representatives can be employees,
              vendors, or other names in QuickBooks.

          sales_tax_code_id: The sales-tax code associated with this customer, determining whether items sold
              to this customer are taxable or non-taxable. It's used to assign a default tax
              status to all transactions for this customer. Default codes include "Non"
              (non-taxable) and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes can also be created in
              QuickBooks. If QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales tax (via the "Do You
              Charge Sales Tax?" preference), it will assign the default non-taxable code to
              all sales.

          sales_tax_country: The country for which sales tax is collected for this customer.

          sales_tax_item_id: The sales-tax item used to calculate the actual tax amount for this customer's
              transactions by applying a specific tax rate collected for a single tax agency.
              Unlike `salesTaxCode`, which only indicates general taxability, this field
              drives the actual tax calculation and reporting.

          salutation: The formal salutation title that precedes the name of the contact person for
              this customer, such as "Mr.", "Ms.", or "Dr.".

          shipping_address: The customer's shipping address.

          tax_registration_number: The customer's tax registration number, for use in Canada or the UK.

          terms_id: The customer's payment terms, defining when payment is due and any applicable
              discounts.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request

          timeout: Override the client-level default timeout for this request, in seconds

        Updates an existing customer.

        Args:
          id: The QuickBooks-assigned unique identifier of the customer to update.

          revision_number: The current revision number of the customer object you are updating, which you
              can get by fetching the object first. Provide the most recent `revisionNumber`
              to ensure you're working with the latest data; otherwise, the update will return
              an error.

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          account_number: The customer's account number, which appears in the QuickBooks chart of
              accounts, reports, and graphs. Note that if the "Use Account Numbers" preference
              is turned off in QuickBooks, the account number may not be visible in the user
              interface, but it can still be set and retrieved through the API.

          additional_contacts: Additional alternate contacts for this customer.

          additional_notes: Additional notes about this customer.

          alternate_contact: The name of a alternate contact person for this customer.

          alternate_phone: The customer's alternate telephone number.

          alternate_shipping_addresses: A list of additional shipping addresses for this customer. Useful when the
              customer has multiple shipping locations.

          billing_address: The customer's billing address.

          cc_email: An email address to carbon copy (CC) on communications with this customer.

          class_id: The customer's class. Classes can be used to categorize objects into meaningful
              segments, such as department, location, or type of work. In QuickBooks, class
              tracking is off by default.

          company_name: The name of the company associated with this customer. This name is used on
              invoices, checks, and other forms.

          contact: The name of the primary contact person for this customer.

          credit_card: The customer's credit card information, including card type, number, and
              expiration date, used for processing credit card payments.

          credit_limit: The customer's credit limit, represented as a decimal string. This is the
              maximum amount of money this customer can spend before being billed. If `null`,
              there is no credit limit.

          currency_id: The customer's currency. For built-in currencies, the name and code are standard
              international values. For user-defined currencies, all values are editable.

          custom_contact_fields: Additional custom contact fields for this customer, such as phone numbers or
              email addresses.

          customer_type_id: The customer's type, used for categorizing customers into meaningful segments,
              such as industry or region.

          email: The customer's email address.

          fax: The customer's fax number.

          first_name: The first name of the contact person for this customer.

          is_active: Indicates whether this customer is active. Inactive objects are typically hidden
              from views and reports in QuickBooks.

          job_description: A brief description of this customer's job, if this object is a job (i.e.,
              sub-customer).

          job_end_date: The actual completion date of this customer's job, if applicable, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          job_projected_end_date: The projected completion date for this customer's job, if applicable, in ISO
              8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          job_start_date: The date when work on this customer's job began, if applicable, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          job_status: The status of this customer's job, if this object is a job (i.e., sub-customer).

          job_title: The job title of the contact person for this customer.

          job_type_id: The type or category of this customer's job, if this object is a job (i.e.,
              sub-customer). Useful for classifying into meaningful segments (e.g., repair,
              installation, consulting).

          last_name: The last name of the contact person for this customer.

          middle_name: The middle name of the contact person for this customer.

          name: The case-insensitive name of this customer. Not guaranteed to be unique because
              it does not include the names of its hierarchical parent objects like `fullName`
              does. For example, two customers could both have the `name` "Website Redesign
              Project", but they could have unique `fullName` values, such as "ABC
              Corporation:Website Redesign Project" and "Baker:Website Redesign Project".
              Maximum length: 41 characters.

          note: Additional notes or comments about this customer.

          parent_id: The parent customer one level above this one in the hierarchy. For example, if
              this customer has a `fullName` of "ABC Corporation:Website Redesign Project",
              its parent has a `fullName` of "ABC Corporation". If this customer is at the top
              level, this field will be `null`.

          phone: The customer's primary telephone number.

          preferred_delivery_method: The preferred method for delivering invoices and other documents to this
              customer.

          preferred_payment_method_id: The customer's preferred payment method (e.g., cash, check, credit card).

          price_level_id: The customer's custom price level that QuickBooks automatically applies to
              calculate item rates in new transactions (e.g., invoices, sales receipts, sales
              orders, and credit memos) for this customer. While applied automatically, this
              can be overridden when creating individual transactions. Note that transactions
              will not show the price level itself, only the final `rate` calculated from it.

          resale_number: The customer's resale number, used if the customer is purchasing items for
              resale. This number does not affect sales tax calculations or reports in
              QuickBooks.

          sales_representative_id: The customer's sales representative. Sales representatives can be employees,
              vendors, or other names in QuickBooks.

          sales_tax_code_id: The sales-tax code associated with this customer, determining whether items sold
              to this customer are taxable or non-taxable. It's used to assign a default tax
              status to all transactions for this customer. Default codes include "Non"
              (non-taxable) and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes can also be created in
              QuickBooks. If QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales tax (via the "Do You
              Charge Sales Tax?" preference), it will assign the default non-taxable code to
              all sales.

          sales_tax_country: The country for which sales tax is collected for this customer.

          sales_tax_item_id: The sales-tax item used to calculate the actual tax amount for this customer's
              transactions by applying a specific tax rate collected for a single tax agency.
              Unlike `salesTaxCode`, which only indicates general taxability, this field
              drives the actual tax calculation and reporting.

          salutation: The formal salutation title that precedes the name of the contact person for
              this customer, such as "Mr.", "Ms.", or "Dr.".

          shipping_address: The customer's shipping address.

          tax_registration_number: The customer's tax registration number, for use in Canada or the UK.

          terms_id: The customer's payment terms, defining when payment is due and any applicable
              discounts.

              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          class_ids: Filter for customers of these classes. A class is a way end-users can categorize
              customers in QuickBooks.

          currency_ids: Filter for customers in these currencies.

          cursor: The pagination token to fetch the next set of results when paginating with the
              `limit` parameter. Retrieve this value from the `nextCursor` field in the
              previous response. If omitted, the API returns the first page of results.

          full_names: Filter for specific customers by their full-name(s), case-insensitive. Like
              `id`, `fullName` is a unique identifier for a customer, formed by by combining
              the names of its parent objects with its own `name`, separated by colons. For
              example, if a customer is under "ABC Corporation" and has the `name` "Website
              Redesign Project", its `fullName` would be "ABC Corporation:Website Redesign
              Project".

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          ids: Filter for specific customers by their QuickBooks-assigned unique identifier(s).

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return. Ranging from 1 to 150, defaults to 150.
              Use this parameter in conjunction with the `cursor` parameter to paginate
              through results. The response will include a `nextCursor` field, which can be
              used as the `cursor` parameter value in subsequent requests to fetch the next
              set of results.

          name_contains: Filter for customers whose `name` contains this substring, case-insensitive.
              NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameStartsWith` or
              `nameEndsWith`.

          name_ends_with: Filter for customers whose `name` ends with this substring, case-insensitive.
              NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameContains` or
              `nameStartsWith`.

          name_from: Filter for customers whose `name` is alphabetically greater than or equal to
              this value.

          name_starts_with: Filter for customers whose `name` starts with this substring, case-insensitive.
              NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameContains` or
              `nameEndsWith`.

          name_to: Filter for customers whose `name` is alphabetically less than or equal to this
              value.

          status: Filter for customers that are active, inactive, or both.

          total_balance: Filter for customers whose `totalBalance` equals this amount, represented as a
              decimal string. You can only use one total-balance filter at a time.

          total_balance_greater_than: Filter for customers whose `totalBalance` is greater than this amount,
              represented as a decimal string. You can only use one total-balance filter at a
              time.

          total_balance_greater_than_or_equal_to: Filter for customers whose `totalBalance` is greater than or equal to this
              amount, represented as a decimal string. You can only use one total-balance
              filter at a time.

          total_balance_less_than: Filter for customers whose `totalBalance` is less than this amount, represented
              as a decimal string. You can only use one total-balance filter at a time.

          total_balance_less_than_or_equal_to: Filter for customers whose `totalBalance` is less than or equal to this amount,
              represented as a decimal string. You can only use one total-balance filter at a

          updated_after: Filter for customers updated on or after this date and time, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time is
              assumed to be 00:00:00 of that day.

          updated_before: Filter for customers updated on or before this date and time, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time is

        Creates a new customer.

        Args:
          name: The case-insensitive name of this customer. Not guaranteed to be unique because
              it does not include the names of its hierarchical parent objects like `fullName`
              does. For example, two customers could both have the `name` "Website Redesign
              Project", but they could have unique `fullName` values, such as "ABC
              Corporation:Website Redesign Project" and "Baker:Website Redesign Project".
              Maximum length: 41 characters.

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          account_number: The customer's account number, which appears in the QuickBooks chart of
              accounts, reports, and graphs. Note that if the "Use Account Numbers" preference
              is turned off in QuickBooks, the account number may not be visible in the user
              interface, but it can still be set and retrieved through the API.

          additional_contacts: Additional alternate contacts for this customer.

          additional_notes: Additional notes about this customer.

          alternate_contact: The name of a alternate contact person for this customer.

          alternate_phone: The customer's alternate telephone number.

          alternate_shipping_addresses: A list of additional shipping addresses for this customer. Useful when the
              customer has multiple shipping locations.

          billing_address: The customer's billing address.

          cc_email: An email address to carbon copy (CC) on communications with this customer.

          class_id: The customer's class. Classes can be used to categorize objects into meaningful
              segments, such as department, location, or type of work. In QuickBooks, class
              tracking is off by default.

          company_name: The name of the company associated with this customer. This name is used on
              invoices, checks, and other forms.

          contact: The name of the primary contact person for this customer.

          credit_card: The customer's credit card information, including card type, number, and
              expiration date, used for processing credit card payments.

          credit_limit: The customer's credit limit, represented as a decimal string. This is the
              maximum amount of money this customer can spend before being billed. If `null`,
              there is no credit limit.

          currency_id: The customer's currency. For built-in currencies, the name and code are standard
              international values. For user-defined currencies, all values are editable.

          custom_contact_fields: Additional custom contact fields for this customer, such as phone numbers or
              email addresses.

          customer_type_id: The customer's type, used for categorizing customers into meaningful segments,
              such as industry or region.

          email: The customer's email address.

          external_id: A globally unique identifier (GUID) you can provide for tracking this object in
              your external system.

              **IMPORTANT**: Must be formatted as a valid GUID; otherwise, QuickBooks will
              return an error. This field is immutable and can only be set during object
              creation.

          fax: The customer's fax number.

          first_name: The first name of the contact person for this customer.

          is_active: Indicates whether this customer is active. Inactive objects are typically hidden
              from views and reports in QuickBooks.

          job_description: A brief description of this customer's job, if this object is a job (i.e.,
              sub-customer).

          job_end_date: The actual completion date of this customer's job, if applicable, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          job_projected_end_date: The projected completion date for this customer's job, if applicable, in ISO
              8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          job_start_date: The date when work on this customer's job began, if applicable, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          job_status: The status of this customer's job, if this object is a job (i.e., sub-customer).

          job_title: The job title of the contact person for this customer.

          job_type_id: The type or category of this customer's job, if this object is a job (i.e.,
              sub-customer). Useful for classifying into meaningful segments (e.g., repair,
              installation, consulting).

          last_name: The last name of the contact person for this customer.

          middle_name: The middle name of the contact person for this customer.

          note: Additional notes or comments about this customer.

          opening_balance: The opening balance of this customer's account, indicating the amount owed by
              this customer, represented as a decimal string.

          opening_balance_date: The date of the opening balance of this customer, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD).

          parent_id: The parent customer one level above this one in the hierarchy. For example, if
              this customer has a `fullName` of "ABC Corporation:Website Redesign Project",
              its parent has a `fullName` of "ABC Corporation". If this customer is at the top
              level, this field will be `null`.

          phone: The customer's primary telephone number.

          preferred_delivery_method: The preferred method for delivering invoices and other documents to this
              customer.

          preferred_payment_method_id: The customer's preferred payment method (e.g., cash, check, credit card).

          price_level_id: The customer's custom price level that QuickBooks automatically applies to
              calculate item rates in new transactions (e.g., invoices, sales receipts, sales
              orders, and credit memos) for this customer. While applied automatically, this
              can be overridden when creating individual transactions. Note that transactions
              will not show the price level itself, only the final `rate` calculated from it.

          resale_number: The customer's resale number, used if the customer is purchasing items for
              resale. This number does not affect sales tax calculations or reports in
              QuickBooks.

          sales_representative_id: The customer's sales representative. Sales representatives can be employees,
              vendors, or other names in QuickBooks.

          sales_tax_code_id: The sales-tax code associated with this customer, determining whether items sold
              to this customer are taxable or non-taxable. It's used to assign a default tax
              status to all transactions for this customer. Default codes include "Non"
              (non-taxable) and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes can also be created in
              QuickBooks. If QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales tax (via the "Do You
              Charge Sales Tax?" preference), it will assign the default non-taxable code to
              all sales.

          sales_tax_country: The country for which sales tax is collected for this customer.

          sales_tax_item_id: The sales-tax item used to calculate the actual tax amount for this customer's
              transactions by applying a specific tax rate collected for a single tax agency.
              Unlike `salesTaxCode`, which only indicates general taxability, this field
              drives the actual tax calculation and reporting.

          salutation: The formal salutation title that precedes the name of the contact person for
              this customer, such as "Mr.", "Ms.", or "Dr.".

          shipping_address: The customer's shipping address.

          tax_registration_number: The customer's tax registration number, for use in Canada or the UK.

          terms_id: The customer's payment terms, defining when payment is due and any applicable
              discounts.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request

          timeout: Override the client-level default timeout for this request, in seconds

        Updates an existing customer.

        Args:
          id: The QuickBooks-assigned unique identifier of the customer to update.

          revision_number: The current revision number of the customer object you are updating, which you
              can get by fetching the object first. Provide the most recent `revisionNumber`
              to ensure you're working with the latest data; otherwise, the update will return
              an error.

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          account_number: The customer's account number, which appears in the QuickBooks chart of
              accounts, reports, and graphs. Note that if the "Use Account Numbers" preference
              is turned off in QuickBooks, the account number may not be visible in the user
              interface, but it can still be set and retrieved through the API.

          additional_contacts: Additional alternate contacts for this customer.

          additional_notes: Additional notes about this customer.

          alternate_contact: The name of a alternate contact person for this customer.

          alternate_phone: The customer's alternate telephone number.

          alternate_shipping_addresses: A list of additional shipping addresses for this customer. Useful when the
              customer has multiple shipping locations.

          billing_address: The customer's billing address.

          cc_email: An email address to carbon copy (CC) on communications with this customer.

          class_id: The customer's class. Classes can be used to categorize objects into meaningful
              segments, such as department, location, or type of work. In QuickBooks, class
              tracking is off by default.

          company_name: The name of the company associated with this customer. This name is used on
              invoices, checks, and other forms.

          contact: The name of the primary contact person for this customer.

          credit_card: The customer's credit card information, including card type, number, and
              expiration date, used for processing credit card payments.

          credit_limit: The customer's credit limit, represented as a decimal string. This is the
              maximum amount of money this customer can spend before being billed. If `null`,
              there is no credit limit.

          currency_id: The customer's currency. For built-in currencies, the name and code are standard
              international values. For user-defined currencies, all values are editable.

          custom_contact_fields: Additional custom contact fields for this customer, such as phone numbers or
              email addresses.

          customer_type_id: The customer's type, used for categorizing customers into meaningful segments,
              such as industry or region.

          email: The customer's email address.

          fax: The customer's fax number.

          first_name: The first name of the contact person for this customer.

          is_active: Indicates whether this customer is active. Inactive objects are typically hidden
              from views and reports in QuickBooks.

          job_description: A brief description of this customer's job, if this object is a job (i.e.,
              sub-customer).

          job_end_date: The actual completion date of this customer's job, if applicable, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          job_projected_end_date: The projected completion date for this customer's job, if applicable, in ISO
              8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          job_start_date: The date when work on this customer's job began, if applicable, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          job_status: The status of this customer's job, if this object is a job (i.e., sub-customer).

          job_title: The job title of the contact person for this customer.

          job_type_id: The type or category of this customer's job, if this object is a job (i.e.,
              sub-customer). Useful for classifying into meaningful segments (e.g., repair,
              installation, consulting).

          last_name: The last name of the contact person for this customer.

          middle_name: The middle name of the contact person for this customer.

          name: The case-insensitive name of this customer. Not guaranteed to be unique because
              it does not include the names of its hierarchical parent objects like `fullName`
              does. For example, two customers could both have the `name` "Website Redesign
              Project", but they could have unique `fullName` values, such as "ABC
              Corporation:Website Redesign Project" and "Baker:Website Redesign Project".
              Maximum length: 41 characters.

          note: Additional notes or comments about this customer.

          parent_id: The parent customer one level above this one in the hierarchy. For example, if
              this customer has a `fullName` of "ABC Corporation:Website Redesign Project",
              its parent has a `fullName` of "ABC Corporation". If this customer is at the top
              level, this field will be `null`.

          phone: The customer's primary telephone number.

          preferred_delivery_method: The preferred method for delivering invoices and other documents to this
              customer.

          preferred_payment_method_id: The customer's preferred payment method (e.g., cash, check, credit card).

          price_level_id: The customer's custom price level that QuickBooks automatically applies to
              calculate item rates in new transactions (e.g., invoices, sales receipts, sales
              orders, and credit memos) for this customer. While applied automatically, this
              can be overridden when creating individual transactions. Note that transactions
              will not show the price level itself, only the final `rate` calculated from it.

          resale_number: The customer's resale number, used if the customer is purchasing items for
              resale. This number does not affect sales tax calculations or reports in
              QuickBooks.

          sales_representative_id: The customer's sales representative. Sales representatives can be employees,
              vendors, or other names in QuickBooks.

          sales_tax_code_id: The sales-tax code associated with this customer, determining whether items sold
              to this customer are taxable or non-taxable. It's used to assign a default tax
              status to all transactions for this customer. Default codes include "Non"
              (non-taxable) and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes can also be created in
              QuickBooks. If QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales tax (via the "Do You
              Charge Sales Tax?" preference), it will assign the default non-taxable code to
              all sales.

          sales_tax_country: The country for which sales tax is collected for this customer.

          sales_tax_item_id: The sales-tax item used to calculate the actual tax amount for this customer's
              transactions by applying a specific tax rate collected for a single tax agency.
              Unlike `salesTaxCode`, which only indicates general taxability, this field
              drives the actual tax calculation and reporting.

          salutation: The formal salutation title that precedes the name of the contact person for
              this customer, such as "Mr.", "Ms.", or "Dr.".

          shipping_address: The customer's shipping address.

          tax_registration_number: The customer's tax registration number, for use in Canada or the UK.

          terms_id: The customer's payment terms, defining when payment is due and any applicable
              discounts.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request

          timeout: Override the client-level default timeout for this request, in seconds

              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          class_ids: Filter for customers of these classes. A class is a way end-users can categorize
              customers in QuickBooks.

          currency_ids: Filter for customers in these currencies.

          cursor: The pagination token to fetch the next set of results when paginating with the
              `limit` parameter. Retrieve this value from the `nextCursor` field in the
              previous response. If omitted, the API returns the first page of results.

          full_names: Filter for specific customers by their full-name(s), case-insensitive. Like
              `id`, `fullName` is a unique identifier for a customer, formed by by combining
              the names of its parent objects with its own `name`, separated by colons. For
              example, if a customer is under "ABC Corporation" and has the `name` "Website
              Redesign Project", its `fullName` would be "ABC Corporation:Website Redesign
              Project".

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          ids: Filter for specific customers by their QuickBooks-assigned unique identifier(s).

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return. Ranging from 1 to 150, defaults to 150.
              Use this parameter in conjunction with the `cursor` parameter to paginate
              through results. The response will include a `nextCursor` field, which can be
              used as the `cursor` parameter value in subsequent requests to fetch the next
              set of results.

          name_contains: Filter for customers whose `name` contains this substring, case-insensitive.
              NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameStartsWith` or
              `nameEndsWith`.

          name_ends_with: Filter for customers whose `name` ends with this substring, case-insensitive.
              NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameContains` or
              `nameStartsWith`.

          name_from: Filter for customers whose `name` is alphabetically greater than or equal to
              this value.

          name_starts_with: Filter for customers whose `name` starts with this substring, case-insensitive.
              NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameContains` or
              `nameEndsWith`.

          name_to: Filter for customers whose `name` is alphabetically less than or equal to this
              value.

          status: Filter for customers that are active, inactive, or both.

          total_balance: Filter for customers whose `totalBalance` equals this amount, represented as a
              decimal string. You can only use one total-balance filter at a time.

          total_balance_greater_than: Filter for customers whose `totalBalance` is greater than this amount,
              represented as a decimal string. You can only use one total-balance filter at a
              time.

          total_balance_greater_than_or_equal_to: Filter for customers whose `totalBalance` is greater than or equal to this
              amount, represented as a decimal string. You can only use one total-balance
              filter at a time.

          total_balance_less_than: Filter for customers whose `totalBalance` is less than this amount, represented

          total_balance_less_than_or_equal_to: Filter for customers whose `totalBalance` is less than or equal to this amount,
              represented as a decimal string. You can only use one total-balance filter at a
              time.

          updated_after: Filter for customers updated on or after this date and time, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time is
              assumed to be 00:00:00 of that day.

          updated_before: Filter for customers updated on or before this date and time, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time is
              assumed to be 23:59:59 of that day.
