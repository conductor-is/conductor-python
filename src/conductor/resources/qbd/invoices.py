        Creates a new invoice.

        Args:
          customer_id: The customer or customer-job associated with this invoice.

          transaction_date: The date of this invoice, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          apply_credits: Credit memos to apply to this invoice, reducing its balance. This creates a link
              between this invoice and the specified credit memos.

              **IMPORTANT**: By default, QuickBooks will not return any information about the
              linked transactions in this endpoint's response even when this request is
              successful. To see the transactions linked via this field, refetch the invoice
              and check the `linkedTransactions` response field. If fetching a list of
              invoices, you must also specify the parameter `includeLinkedTransactions=true`
              to see the `linkedTransactions` response field.

          billing_address: The invoice's billing address.

          class_id: The invoice's class. Classes can be used to categorize objects into meaningful
              segments, such as department, location, or type of work. In QuickBooks, class
              tracking is off by default. A class defined here is automatically used in this
              invoice's line items unless overridden at the line item level.

          customer_message_id: The message to display to the customer on the invoice.

          document_template_id: The predefined template in QuickBooks that determines the layout and formatting
              for this invoice when printed or displayed.

          due_date: The date by which this invoice must be paid, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          exchange_rate: The market exchange rate between this invoice's currency and the home currency
              in QuickBooks at the time of this transaction. Represented as a decimal value
              (e.g., 1.2345 for 1 EUR = 1.2345 USD if USD is the home currency).

          external_id: A globally unique identifier (GUID) you can provide for tracking this object in
              your external system.

              **IMPORTANT**: Must be formatted as a valid GUID; otherwise, QuickBooks will
              return an error. This field is immutable and can only be set during object
              creation.

          is_finance_charge: Whether this invoice includes a finance charge. This field is immutable and can
              only be set during invoice creation.

          is_pending: Indicates whether this invoice is pending approval or completion. If `true`, the
              invoice is in a draft state and has not been finalized.

          is_queued_for_email: Indicates whether this invoice is included in the queue of documents for
              QuickBooks to email to the customer.

          is_queued_for_print: Indicates whether this invoice is included in the queue of documents for
              QuickBooks to print.

          line_groups: The invoice's line item groups, each representing a predefined set of related
              items.

          lines: The invoice's line items, each representing a single product or service sold.

          link_to_transaction_ids: IDs of existing transactions that you wish to link to this invoice, such as
              payments applied, credits used, or associated purchase orders. Note that this
              links entire transactions, not individual transaction lines. If you want to link
              individual lines in a transaction, instead use the field `linkToTransactionLine`
              on this invoice's lines, if available.

              Transactions can only be linked when creating this invoice and cannot be
              unlinked later.

              You can use both `linkToTransactionIds` (on this invoice) and
              `linkToTransactionLine` (on its transaction lines) as long as they do NOT link
              to the same transaction (otherwise, QuickBooks will return an error). QuickBooks
              will also return an error if you attempt to link a transaction that is empty or
              already closed.

              **IMPORTANT**: By default, QuickBooks will not return any information about the
              linked transactions in this endpoint's response even when this request is
              successful. To see the transactions linked via this field, refetch the invoice
              and check the `linkedTransactions` response field. If fetching a list of
              invoices, you must also specify the parameter `includeLinkedTransactions=true`
              to see the `linkedTransactions` response field.

          memo: A memo or note for this invoice, as entered by the user. This appears in
              reports, but not on the invoice. Use `customerMessage` to add a note to the
              invoice.

          other_custom_field: A built-in custom field for additional information specific to this invoice.
              Unlike the user-defined fields in the `customFields` array, this is a standard
              QuickBooks field that exists for all invoices for convenience. Developers often
              use this field for tracking information that doesn't fit into other standard
              QuickBooks fields. Unlike `otherCustomField1` and `otherCustomField2`, which are
              line item fields, this exists at the transaction level. Hidden by default in the
              QuickBooks UI.

          purchase_order_number: The customer's Purchase Order (PO) number associated with this invoice. This
              field is often used to cross-reference the invoice with the customer's
              purchasing system.

          receivables_account_id: The Accounts-Receivable (A/R) account to which this invoice is assigned, used to
              track the amount owed. If not specified, QuickBooks Desktop will use its default
              Accounts-Receivable account.

              **IMPORTANT**: If this invoice is linked to other transactions, this A/R account
              must match the `receivablesAccount` used in those other transactions.

          ref_number: The case-sensitive user-defined reference number for this invoice, which can be
              used to identify the transaction in QuickBooks. This value is not required to be
              unique and can be arbitrarily changed by the QuickBooks user.

          sales_representative_id: The invoice's sales representative. Sales representatives can be employees,
              vendors, or other names in QuickBooks.

          sales_tax_code_id: The sales-tax code for items sold to the `customer` of this invoice, determining
              whether items sold to this customer are taxable or non-taxable. Default codes
              include "Non" (non-taxable) and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes can also be
              created in QuickBooks. If QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales tax (via the
              "Do You Charge Sales Tax?" preference), it will assign the default non-taxable
              code to all sales.

          sales_tax_item_id: The sales-tax item used to calculate the actual tax amount for this invoice's
              transactions by applying a specific tax rate collected for a single tax agency.
              Unlike `salesTaxCode`, which only indicates general taxability, this field
              drives the actual tax calculation and reporting.

          shipment_origin: The origin location from where the product associated with this invoice is
              shipped. This is the point at which ownership and liability for goods transfer
              from seller to buyer. Internally, QuickBooks uses the term "FOB" for this field,
              which stands for "freight on board". This field is informational and has no
              accounting implications.

          shipping_address: The invoice's shipping address.

          shipping_date: The date when the products or services for this invoice were shipped or are
              expected to be shipped, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          shipping_method_id: The shipping method used for this invoice, such as standard mail or overnight
              delivery.

          terms_id: The invoice's payment terms, defining when payment is due and any applicable
              discounts.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request

          timeout: Override the client-level default timeout for this request, in seconds

              for this invoice when printed or displayed.

          due_date: The date by which this invoice must be paid, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          exchange_rate: The market exchange rate between this invoice's currency and the home currency
              in QuickBooks at the time of this transaction. Represented as a decimal value
              (e.g., 1.2345 for 1 EUR = 1.2345 USD if USD is the home currency).

          is_pending: Indicates whether this invoice is pending approval or completion. If `true`, the
              invoice is in a draft state and has not been finalized.

          is_queued_for_email: Indicates whether this invoice is included in the queue of documents for
              QuickBooks to email to the customer.

          is_queued_for_print: Indicates whether this invoice is included in the queue of documents for
              QuickBooks to print.

          line_groups: The invoice's line item groups, each representing a predefined set of related
              items.

              **IMPORTANT**: When updating an invoice's line item groups, this array
              completely REPLACES all existing line item groups for that invoice. To retain
              any current line item groups, include them in this array, even if they have not
              changed. Any line item groups not included will be removed. To add a new line
              item group, include it with its `id` set to `-1`. If you do not wish to modify
              the line item groups, you can omit this field entirely to keep them unchanged.

          lines: The invoice's line items, each representing a single product or service sold.

              **IMPORTANT**: When updating an invoice's line items, this array completely
              REPLACES all existing line items for that invoice. To retain any current line
              items, include them in this array, even if they have not changed. Any line items
              not included will be removed. To add a new line item, include it with its `id`
              set to `-1`. If you do not wish to modify the line items, you can omit this
              field entirely to keep them unchanged.

          memo: A memo or note for this invoice, as entered by the user. This appears in
              reports, but not on the invoice. Use `customerMessage` to add a note to the
              invoice.

          other_custom_field: A built-in custom field for additional information specific to this invoice.
              Unlike the user-defined fields in the `customFields` array, this is a standard
              QuickBooks field that exists for all invoices for convenience. Developers often
              use this field for tracking information that doesn't fit into other standard
              QuickBooks fields. Unlike `otherCustomField1` and `otherCustomField2`, which are
              line item fields, this exists at the transaction level. Hidden by default in the
              QuickBooks UI.

          purchase_order_number: The customer's Purchase Order (PO) number associated with this invoice. This
              field is often used to cross-reference the invoice with the customer's
              purchasing system.

          receivables_account_id: The Accounts-Receivable (A/R) account to which this invoice is assigned, used to
              track the amount owed. If not specified, QuickBooks Desktop will use its default
              Accounts-Receivable account.

              **IMPORTANT**: If this invoice is linked to other transactions, this A/R account
              must match the `receivablesAccount` used in those other transactions.

          ref_number: The case-sensitive user-defined reference number for this invoice, which can be
              used to identify the transaction in QuickBooks. This value is not required to be
              unique and can be arbitrarily changed by the QuickBooks user.

          sales_representative_id: The invoice's sales representative. Sales representatives can be employees,
              vendors, or other names in QuickBooks.

          sales_tax_code_id: The sales-tax code for items sold to the `customer` of this invoice, determining
              whether items sold to this customer are taxable or non-taxable. Default codes
              include "Non" (non-taxable) and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes can also be
              created in QuickBooks. If QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales tax (via the
              "Do You Charge Sales Tax?" preference), it will assign the default non-taxable
              code to all sales.

          sales_tax_item_id: The sales-tax item used to calculate the actual tax amount for this invoice's
              transactions by applying a specific tax rate collected for a single tax agency.
              Unlike `salesTaxCode`, which only indicates general taxability, this field
              drives the actual tax calculation and reporting.

          shipment_origin: The origin location from where the product associated with this invoice is
              shipped. This is the point at which ownership and liability for goods transfer
              from seller to buyer. Internally, QuickBooks uses the term "FOB" for this field,
              which stands for "freight on board". This field is informational and has no
              accounting implications.

          shipping_address: The invoice's shipping address.

          shipping_date: The date when the products or services for this invoice were shipped or are
              expected to be shipped, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          shipping_method_id: The shipping method used for this invoice, such as standard mail or overnight
              delivery.

          terms_id: The invoice's payment terms, defining when payment is due and any applicable
              discounts.

          transaction_date: The date of this invoice, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

        Returns a list of invoices.

        Args:
          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          account_ids: Filter for invoices from these accounts.

          currency_ids: Filter for invoices in these currencies.

          cursor: The pagination token to fetch the next set of results when paginating with the
              `limit` parameter. Retrieve this value from the `nextCursor` field in the
              previous response. If omitted, the API returns the first page of results.

          customer_ids: Filter for invoices for these customers.

          ids: Filter for specific invoices by their QuickBooks-assigned unique identifier(s).

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          include_line_items: Whether to include line items in the response. Defaults to `true`.

          include_linked_transactions: Whether to include linked transactions in the response. Defaults to `false`. For
              example, a payment linked to the corresponding invoice.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return. Ranging from 1 to 150, defaults to 150.
              Use this parameter in conjunction with the `cursor` parameter to paginate
              through results. The response will include a `nextCursor` field, which can be
              used as the `cursor` parameter value in subsequent requests to fetch the next
              set of results.

          payment_status: Filter for invoices that are paid, not paid, or both.

          ref_number_contains: Filter for invoices whose `refNumber` contains this substring. NOTE: If you use
              this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberStartsWith` or
              `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_ends_with: Filter for invoices whose `refNumber` ends with this substring. NOTE: If you use
              this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberStartsWith`.

          ref_number_from: Filter for invoices whose `refNumber` is greater than or equal to this value. If
              omitted, the range will begin with the first number of the list. Uses a
              numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.

          ref_numbers: Filter for specific invoices by their ref-number(s), case-sensitive. In
              QuickBooks, ref-numbers are not required to be unique and can be arbitrarily
              changed by the QuickBooks user.

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          ref_number_starts_with: Filter for invoices whose `refNumber` starts with this substring. NOTE: If you
              use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_to: Filter for invoices whose `refNumber` is less than or equal to this value. If
              omitted, the range will end with the last number of the list. Uses a numerical
              comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.

          transaction_date_from: Filter for invoices created on or after this date, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD).

          transaction_date_to: Filter for invoices created on or before this date, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD).

          updated_after: Filter for invoices updated on or after this date and time, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time is
              assumed to be 00:00:00 of that day.

          updated_before: Filter for invoices updated on or before this date and time, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time is

          customer_id: The customer or customer-job associated with this invoice.

          transaction_date: The date of this invoice, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          apply_credits: Credit memos to apply to this invoice, reducing its balance. This creates a link
              between this invoice and the specified credit memos.

              **IMPORTANT**: By default, QuickBooks will not return any information about the
              linked transactions in this endpoint's response even when this request is
              successful. To see the transactions linked via this field, refetch the invoice
              and check the `linkedTransactions` response field. If fetching a list of
              invoices, you must also specify the parameter `includeLinkedTransactions=true`
              to see the `linkedTransactions` response field.

          billing_address: The invoice's billing address.

          class_id: The invoice's class. Classes can be used to categorize objects into meaningful
              segments, such as department, location, or type of work. In QuickBooks, class
              tracking is off by default. A class defined here is automatically used in this
              invoice's line items unless overridden at the line item level.

          customer_message_id: The message to display to the customer on the invoice.

          document_template_id: The predefined template in QuickBooks that determines the layout and formatting
              for this invoice when printed or displayed.

          due_date: The date by which this invoice must be paid, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          exchange_rate: The market exchange rate between this invoice's currency and the home currency
              in QuickBooks at the time of this transaction. Represented as a decimal value
              (e.g., 1.2345 for 1 EUR = 1.2345 USD if USD is the home currency).

          external_id: A globally unique identifier (GUID) you can provide for tracking this object in
              your external system.

              **IMPORTANT**: Must be formatted as a valid GUID; otherwise, QuickBooks will
              return an error. This field is immutable and can only be set during object
              creation.

          is_finance_charge: Whether this invoice includes a finance charge. This field is immutable and can
              only be set during invoice creation.

          is_pending: Indicates whether this invoice is pending approval or completion. If `true`, the
              invoice is in a draft state and has not been finalized.

          is_queued_for_email: Indicates whether this invoice is included in the queue of documents for
              QuickBooks to email to the customer.

          is_queued_for_print: Indicates whether this invoice is included in the queue of documents for
              QuickBooks to print.

          line_groups: The invoice's line item groups, each representing a predefined set of related
              items.

          lines: The invoice's line items, each representing a single product or service sold.

          link_to_transaction_ids: IDs of existing transactions that you wish to link to this invoice, such as
              payments applied, credits used, or associated purchase orders. Note that this
              links entire transactions, not individual transaction lines. If you want to link
              individual lines in a transaction, instead use the field `linkToTransactionLine`
              on this invoice's lines, if available.

              Transactions can only be linked when creating this invoice and cannot be
              unlinked later.

              You can use both `linkToTransactionIds` (on this invoice) and
              `linkToTransactionLine` (on its transaction lines) as long as they do NOT link
              to the same transaction (otherwise, QuickBooks will return an error). QuickBooks
              will also return an error if you attempt to link a transaction that is empty or
              already closed.

              **IMPORTANT**: By default, QuickBooks will not return any information about the
              linked transactions in this endpoint's response even when this request is
              successful. To see the transactions linked via this field, refetch the invoice
              and check the `linkedTransactions` response field. If fetching a list of
              invoices, you must also specify the parameter `includeLinkedTransactions=true`
              to see the `linkedTransactions` response field.

          memo: A memo or note for this invoice, as entered by the user. This appears in
              reports, but not on the invoice. Use `customerMessage` to add a note to the
              invoice.

          other_custom_field: A built-in custom field for additional information specific to this invoice.
              Unlike the user-defined fields in the `customFields` array, this is a standard
              QuickBooks field that exists for all invoices for convenience. Developers often
              use this field for tracking information that doesn't fit into other standard
              QuickBooks fields. Unlike `otherCustomField1` and `otherCustomField2`, which are
              line item fields, this exists at the transaction level. Hidden by default in the
              QuickBooks UI.

          purchase_order_number: The customer's Purchase Order (PO) number associated with this invoice. This
              field is often used to cross-reference the invoice with the customer's
              purchasing system.

          receivables_account_id: The Accounts-Receivable (A/R) account to which this invoice is assigned, used to
              track the amount owed. If not specified, QuickBooks Desktop will use its default
              Accounts-Receivable account.

              **IMPORTANT**: If this invoice is linked to other transactions, this A/R account
              must match the `receivablesAccount` used in those other transactions.

          ref_number: The case-sensitive user-defined reference number for this invoice, which can be
              used to identify the transaction in QuickBooks. This value is not required to be
              unique and can be arbitrarily changed by the QuickBooks user.

          sales_representative_id: The invoice's sales representative. Sales representatives can be employees,
              vendors, or other names in QuickBooks.

          sales_tax_code_id: The sales-tax code for items sold to the `customer` of this invoice, determining
              whether items sold to this customer are taxable or non-taxable. Default codes
              include "Non" (non-taxable) and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes can also be
              created in QuickBooks. If QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales tax (via the
              "Do You Charge Sales Tax?" preference), it will assign the default non-taxable
              code to all sales.

          sales_tax_item_id: The sales-tax item used to calculate the actual tax amount for this invoice's
              transactions by applying a specific tax rate collected for a single tax agency.
              Unlike `salesTaxCode`, which only indicates general taxability, this field
              drives the actual tax calculation and reporting.

          shipment_origin: The origin location from where the product associated with this invoice is
              shipped. This is the point at which ownership and liability for goods transfer
              from seller to buyer. Internally, QuickBooks uses the term "FOB" for this field,
              which stands for "freight on board". This field is informational and has no
              accounting implications.

          shipping_address: The invoice's shipping address.

          shipping_date: The date when the products or services for this invoice were shipped or are
              expected to be shipped, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          shipping_method_id: The shipping method used for this invoice, such as standard mail or overnight
              delivery.

          terms_id: The invoice's payment terms, defining when payment is due and any applicable
              discounts.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

              "Do You Charge Sales Tax?" preference), it will assign the default non-taxable
              code to all sales.

          sales_tax_item_id: The sales-tax item used to calculate the actual tax amount for this invoice's
              transactions by applying a specific tax rate collected for a single tax agency.
              Unlike `salesTaxCode`, which only indicates general taxability, this field
              drives the actual tax calculation and reporting.

          shipment_origin: The origin location from where the product associated with this invoice is
              shipped. This is the point at which ownership and liability for goods transfer
              from seller to buyer. Internally, QuickBooks uses the term "FOB" for this field,
              which stands for "freight on board". This field is informational and has no
              accounting implications.

          shipping_address: The invoice's shipping address.

          shipping_date: The date when the products or services for this invoice were shipped or are
              expected to be shipped, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          shipping_method_id: The shipping method used for this invoice, such as standard mail or overnight
              delivery.

          terms_id: The invoice's payment terms, defining when payment is due and any applicable
              discounts.

          transaction_date: The date of this invoice, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request

        Returns a list of invoices.

        Args:
          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          account_ids: Filter for invoices from these accounts.

          currency_ids: Filter for invoices in these currencies.

          cursor: The pagination token to fetch the next set of results when paginating with the
              `limit` parameter. Retrieve this value from the `nextCursor` field in the
              previous response. If omitted, the API returns the first page of results.

          customer_ids: Filter for invoices for these customers.

          ids: Filter for specific invoices by their QuickBooks-assigned unique identifier(s).

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          include_line_items: Whether to include line items in the response. Defaults to `true`.

          include_linked_transactions: Whether to include linked transactions in the response. Defaults to `false`. For
              example, a payment linked to the corresponding invoice.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return. Ranging from 1 to 150, defaults to 150.
              Use this parameter in conjunction with the `cursor` parameter to paginate
              through results. The response will include a `nextCursor` field, which can be
              used as the `cursor` parameter value in subsequent requests to fetch the next
              set of results.

          payment_status: Filter for invoices that are paid, not paid, or both.

          ref_number_contains: Filter for invoices whose `refNumber` contains this substring. NOTE: If you use
              this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberStartsWith` or
              `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_ends_with: Filter for invoices whose `refNumber` ends with this substring. NOTE: If you use
              this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberStartsWith`.

          ref_number_from: Filter for invoices whose `refNumber` is greater than or equal to this value. If
              omitted, the range will begin with the first number of the list. Uses a
              numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.

          ref_numbers: Filter for specific invoices by their ref-number(s), case-sensitive. In
              QuickBooks, ref-numbers are not required to be unique and can be arbitrarily
              changed by the QuickBooks user.

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          ref_number_starts_with: Filter for invoices whose `refNumber` starts with this substring. NOTE: If you
              use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_to: Filter for invoices whose `refNumber` is less than or equal to this value. If
              omitted, the range will end with the last number of the list. Uses a numerical
              comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.

          transaction_date_from: Filter for invoices created on or after this date, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD).

          transaction_date_to: Filter for invoices created on or before this date, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD).

          updated_after: Filter for invoices updated on or after this date and time, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time is
              assumed to be 00:00:00 of that day.

          updated_before: Filter for invoices updated on or before this date and time, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time is
              assumed to be 23:59:59 of that day.
