        Creates a new bill.

        Args:
          transaction_date: The date of this bill, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          vendor_id: The vendor who sent this bill for goods or services purchased.

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          due_date: The date by which this bill must be paid, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          exchange_rate: The market exchange rate between this bill's currency and the home currency in
              QuickBooks at the time of this transaction. Represented as a decimal value
              (e.g., 1.2345 for 1 EUR = 1.2345 USD if USD is the home currency).

          expense_lines: The bill's expense lines, each representing one line in this expense.

          external_id: A globally unique identifier (GUID) you, the developer, can provide for tracking
              this object in your external system. This field is immutable and can only be set
              during object creation.

              **IMPORTANT**: This field must be formatted as a valid GUID; otherwise,
              QuickBooks will return an error.

          item_line_groups: The bill's item group lines, each representing a predefined set of items bundled
              together because they are commonly purchased together or grouped for faster
              entry.

          item_lines: The bill's item lines, each representing the purchase of a specific item or
              service.

          link_to_transaction_ids: IDs of existing transactions that you wish to link to this bill, such as
              payments applied, credits used, or associated purchase orders. Note that this
              links entire transactions, not individual transaction lines. If you want to link
              individual lines in a transaction, instead use the field `linkToTransactionLine`
              on this bill's lines, if available.

              Transactions can only be linked when creating this bill and cannot be unlinked
              later.

              You can use both `linkToTransactionIds` (on this bill) and
              `linkToTransactionLine` (on its transaction lines) as long as they do NOT link
              to the same transaction (otherwise, QuickBooks will return an error). QuickBooks
              will also return an error if you attempt to link a transaction that is empty or
              already closed.

              **IMPORTANT**: By default, QuickBooks will not return any information about the
              linked transactions in this endpoint's response even when this request is
              successful. To see the transactions linked via this field, refetch the bill and
              check the `linkedTransactions` response field. If fetching a list of bills, you
              must also specify the parameter `includeLinkedTransactions=true` to see the
              `linkedTransactions` response field.

          memo: A memo or note for this bill that appears in the Accounts-Payable register and
              in reports that include this bill.

          payables_account_id: The Accounts-Payable (A/P) account to which this bill is assigned, used to track
              the amount owed. If not specified, QuickBooks Desktop will use its default A/P
              account.

              **IMPORTANT**: If this bill is linked to other transactions, this A/P account
              must match the `payablesAccount` used in those other transactions.

          ref_number: The case-sensitive user-defined reference number for this bill, which can be
              used to identify the transaction in QuickBooks. This value is not required to be
              unique and can be arbitrarily changed by the QuickBooks user. When left blank in
              this create request, this field will be left blank in QuickBooks (i.e., it does
              _not_ auto-increment).

          sales_tax_code_id: The sales-tax code for this bill, determining whether it is taxable or
              non-taxable. If set, this overrides any sales-tax codes defined on the vendor.
              This can be overridden on the bill's individual lines.

              Default codes include "Non" (non-taxable) and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes
              can also be created in QuickBooks. If QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales
              tax (via the "Do You Charge Sales Tax?" preference), it will assign the default
              non-taxable code to all sales.

          terms_id: The bill's payment terms, defining when payment is due and any applicable
              discounts.

          vendor_address: The address of the vendor who sent this bill.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request

          timeout: Override the client-level default timeout for this request, in seconds

        Use the `cursor` parameter to paginate through the
        results.

        Args:
          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          account_ids: Filter for bills associated with these accounts.

          currency_ids: Filter for bills in these currencies.

          cursor: The pagination token to fetch the next set of results when paginating with the
              `limit` parameter. Do not include this parameter on the first call. Use the
              `nextCursor` value returned in the previous response to request subsequent
              results.

          ids: Filter for specific bills by their QuickBooks-assigned unique identifier(s).

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          include_line_items: Whether to include line items in the response. Defaults to `true`.

          include_linked_transactions: Whether to include linked transactions in the response. Defaults to `false`. For
              example, a payment linked to the corresponding bill.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return. Accepts values ranging from 1 to 150,
              defaults to 150. When used with cursor-based pagination, this parameter controls
              how many results are returned per page. To paginate through results, combine
              this with the `cursor` parameter. Each response will include a `nextCursor`
              value that can be passed to subsequent requests to retrieve the next page of
              results.

          payment_status: Filter for bills that are paid, not paid, or both.

          ref_number_contains: Filter for bills whose `refNumber` contains this substring. NOTE: If you use
              this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberStartsWith` or
              `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_ends_with: Filter for bills whose `refNumber` ends with this substring. NOTE: If you use
              this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberStartsWith`.

          ref_number_from: Filter for bills whose `refNumber` is greater than or equal to this value. If
              omitted, the range will begin with the first number of the list. Uses a
              numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.

          ref_numbers: Filter for specific bills by their ref-number(s), case-sensitive. In QuickBooks,
              ref-numbers are not required to be unique and can be arbitrarily changed by the
              QuickBooks user.

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          ref_number_starts_with: Filter for bills whose `refNumber` starts with this substring. NOTE: If you use
              this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_to: Filter for bills whose `refNumber` is less than or equal to this value. If
              omitted, the range will end with the last number of the list. Uses a numerical
              comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.

          transaction_date_from: Filter for bills created on or after this date, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          transaction_date_to: Filter for bills created on or before this date, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD).

          updated_after: Filter for bills updated on or after this date and time, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time is
              assumed to be 00:00:00 of that day.

          updated_before: Filter for bills updated on or before this date and time, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time is
              assumed to be 23:59:59 of that day.

          vendor_ids: Filter for bills received from these vendors.

        Creates a new bill.

        Args:
          transaction_date: The date of this bill, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          vendor_id: The vendor who sent this bill for goods or services purchased.

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          due_date: The date by which this bill must be paid, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          exchange_rate: The market exchange rate between this bill's currency and the home currency in
              QuickBooks at the time of this transaction. Represented as a decimal value
              (e.g., 1.2345 for 1 EUR = 1.2345 USD if USD is the home currency).

          expense_lines: The bill's expense lines, each representing one line in this expense.

          external_id: A globally unique identifier (GUID) you, the developer, can provide for tracking
              this object in your external system. This field is immutable and can only be set
              during object creation.

              **IMPORTANT**: This field must be formatted as a valid GUID; otherwise,
              QuickBooks will return an error.

          item_line_groups: The bill's item group lines, each representing a predefined set of items bundled
              together because they are commonly purchased together or grouped for faster
              entry.

          item_lines: The bill's item lines, each representing the purchase of a specific item or
              service.

          link_to_transaction_ids: IDs of existing transactions that you wish to link to this bill, such as
              payments applied, credits used, or associated purchase orders. Note that this
              links entire transactions, not individual transaction lines. If you want to link
              individual lines in a transaction, instead use the field `linkToTransactionLine`
              on this bill's lines, if available.

              Transactions can only be linked when creating this bill and cannot be unlinked
              later.

              You can use both `linkToTransactionIds` (on this bill) and
              `linkToTransactionLine` (on its transaction lines) as long as they do NOT link
              to the same transaction (otherwise, QuickBooks will return an error). QuickBooks
              will also return an error if you attempt to link a transaction that is empty or
              already closed.

              **IMPORTANT**: By default, QuickBooks will not return any information about the
              linked transactions in this endpoint's response even when this request is
              successful. To see the transactions linked via this field, refetch the bill and
              check the `linkedTransactions` response field. If fetching a list of bills, you
              must also specify the parameter `includeLinkedTransactions=true` to see the
              `linkedTransactions` response field.

          memo: A memo or note for this bill that appears in the Accounts-Payable register and
              in reports that include this bill.

          payables_account_id: The Accounts-Payable (A/P) account to which this bill is assigned, used to track
              the amount owed. If not specified, QuickBooks Desktop will use its default A/P
              account.

              **IMPORTANT**: If this bill is linked to other transactions, this A/P account
              must match the `payablesAccount` used in those other transactions.

          ref_number: The case-sensitive user-defined reference number for this bill, which can be
              used to identify the transaction in QuickBooks. This value is not required to be
              unique and can be arbitrarily changed by the QuickBooks user. When left blank in
              this create request, this field will be left blank in QuickBooks (i.e., it does
              _not_ auto-increment).

          sales_tax_code_id: The sales-tax code for this bill, determining whether it is taxable or
              non-taxable. If set, this overrides any sales-tax codes defined on the vendor.
              This can be overridden on the bill's individual lines.

              Default codes include "Non" (non-taxable) and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes
              can also be created in QuickBooks. If QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales
              tax (via the "Do You Charge Sales Tax?" preference), it will assign the default
              non-taxable code to all sales.

          terms_id: The bill's payment terms, defining when payment is due and any applicable
              discounts.

          vendor_address: The address of the vendor who sent this bill.

        Updates an existing bill.

        Args:
          id: The QuickBooks-assigned unique identifier of the bill to update.

          revision_number: The current QuickBooks-assigned revision number of the bill object you are
              updating, which you can get by fetching the object first. Provide the most
              recent `revisionNumber` to ensure you're working with the latest data;
              otherwise, the update will return an error.

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          clear_expense_lines: When `true`, removes all existing expense lines associated with this bill. To
              modify or add individual expense lines, use the field `expenseLines` instead.

          clear_item_lines: When `true`, removes all existing item lines associated with this bill. To
              modify or add individual item lines, use the field `itemLines` instead.

          due_date: The date by which this bill must be paid, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          exchange_rate: The market exchange rate between this bill's currency and the home currency in
              QuickBooks at the time of this transaction. Represented as a decimal value
              (e.g., 1.2345 for 1 EUR = 1.2345 USD if USD is the home currency).

          expense_lines: The bill's expense lines, each representing one line in this expense.

              **IMPORTANT**:

              1. Including this array in your update request will **REPLACE** all existing
                 expense lines for the bill with this array. To keep any existing expense
                 lines, you must include them in this array even if they have not changed.
                 **Any expense lines not included will be removed.**

              2. To add a new expense line, include it here with the `id` field set to `-1`.

              3. If you do not wish to modify any expense lines, omit this field entirely to
                 keep them unchanged.

          item_line_groups: The bill's item group lines, each representing a predefined set of items bundled
              together because they are commonly purchased together or grouped for faster
              entry.

              **IMPORTANT**:

              1. Including this array in your update request will **REPLACE** all existing
                 item group lines for the bill with this array. To keep any existing item
                 group lines, you must include them in this array even if they have not
                 changed. **Any item group lines not included will be removed.**

              2. To add a new item group line, include it here with the `id` field set to
                 `-1`.

              3. If you do not wish to modify any item group lines, omit this field entirely
                 to keep them unchanged.

          item_lines: The bill's item lines, each representing the purchase of a specific item or
              service.

              **IMPORTANT**:

              1. Including this array in your update request will **REPLACE** all existing
                 item lines for the bill with this array. To keep any existing item lines, you
                 must include them in this array even if they have not changed. **Any item
                 lines not included will be removed.**

              2. To add a new item line, include it here with the `id` field set to `-1`.

              3. If you do not wish to modify any item lines, omit this field entirely to keep
                 them unchanged.

          memo: A memo or note for this bill that appears in the Accounts-Payable register and
              in reports that include this bill.

          payables_account_id: The Accounts-Payable (A/P) account to which this bill is assigned, used to track
              the amount owed. If not specified, QuickBooks Desktop will use its default A/P
              account.

              **IMPORTANT**: If this bill is linked to other transactions, this A/P account
              must match the `payablesAccount` used in those other transactions.

          ref_number: The case-sensitive user-defined reference number for this bill, which can be
              used to identify the transaction in QuickBooks. This value is not required to be
              unique and can be arbitrarily changed by the QuickBooks user.

          sales_tax_code_id: The sales-tax code for this bill, determining whether it is taxable or
              non-taxable. If set, this overrides any sales-tax codes defined on the vendor.
              This can be overridden on the bill's individual lines.

              Default codes include "Non" (non-taxable) and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes
              can also be created in QuickBooks. If QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales
              tax (via the "Do You Charge Sales Tax?" preference), it will assign the default
              non-taxable code to all sales.

          terms_id: The bill's payment terms, defining when payment is due and any applicable
              discounts.

          transaction_date: The date of this bill, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          vendor_address: The address of the vendor who sent this bill.

          vendor_id: The vendor who sent this bill for goods or services purchased.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request

          timeout: Override the client-level default timeout for this request, in seconds

        Args:
          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          account_ids: Filter for bills associated with these accounts.

          currency_ids: Filter for bills in these currencies.

          cursor: The pagination token to fetch the next set of results when paginating with the
              `limit` parameter. Do not include this parameter on the first call. Use the
              `nextCursor` value returned in the previous response to request subsequent
              results.

          ids: Filter for specific bills by their QuickBooks-assigned unique identifier(s).

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          include_line_items: Whether to include line items in the response. Defaults to `true`.

          include_linked_transactions: Whether to include linked transactions in the response. Defaults to `false`. For
              example, a payment linked to the corresponding bill.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return. Accepts values ranging from 1 to 150,
              defaults to 150. When used with cursor-based pagination, this parameter controls
              how many results are returned per page. To paginate through results, combine
              this with the `cursor` parameter. Each response will include a `nextCursor`
              value that can be passed to subsequent requests to retrieve the next page of
              results.

          payment_status: Filter for bills that are paid, not paid, or both.

          ref_number_contains: Filter for bills whose `refNumber` contains this substring. NOTE: If you use
              this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberStartsWith` or
              `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_ends_with: Filter for bills whose `refNumber` ends with this substring. NOTE: If you use
              this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberStartsWith`.

          ref_number_from: Filter for bills whose `refNumber` is greater than or equal to this value. If
              omitted, the range will begin with the first number of the list. Uses a
              numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.

          ref_numbers: Filter for specific bills by their ref-number(s), case-sensitive. In QuickBooks,
              ref-numbers are not required to be unique and can be arbitrarily changed by the
              QuickBooks user.

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          ref_number_starts_with: Filter for bills whose `refNumber` starts with this substring. NOTE: If you use
              this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_to: Filter for bills whose `refNumber` is less than or equal to this value. If
              omitted, the range will end with the last number of the list. Uses a numerical
              comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.

          transaction_date_from: Filter for bills created on or after this date, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          transaction_date_to: Filter for bills created on or before this date, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD).

          updated_after: Filter for bills updated on or after this date and time, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time is
