        Creates a new inventory assembly item.

        Args:
          asset_account_id: The asset account used to track the current value of this inventory assembly
              item in inventory.

          cogs_account_id: The Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) account for this inventory assembly item, tracking
              the original direct costs of producing goods sold.

          income_account_id: The income account used to track revenue from sales of this inventory assembly
              item.

          name: The case-insensitive name of this inventory assembly item. Not guaranteed to be
              unique because it does not include the names of its hierarchical parent objects
              like `fullName` does. For example, two inventory assembly items could both have
              the `name` "Deluxe Kit", but they could have unique `fullName` values, such as
              "Assemblies:Deluxe Kit" and "Inventory:Deluxe Kit". Maximum length: 31
              characters.

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          barcode: The inventory assembly item's barcode.

          build_notification_threshold: The inventory assembly item's minimum quantity threshold that triggers a build
              notification in QuickBooks. When the sum of `quantityOnHand` (current inventory)
              and `quantityOnOrder` (pending purchase orders) drops below this threshold,
              QuickBooks will notify users that more units need to be built or assembled. This
              helps ensure adequate inventory levels for inventory assembly items.

          class_id: The inventory assembly item's class. Classes can be used to categorize objects
              into meaningful segments, such as department, location, or type of work. In
              QuickBooks, class tracking is off by default.

          external_id: A globally unique identifier (GUID) you can provide for tracking this object in
              your external system.

              **IMPORTANT**: Must be formatted as a valid GUID; otherwise, QuickBooks will
              return an error. This field is immutable and can only be set during object
              creation.

          inventory_date: The date when this inventory assembly item was converted into an inventory item
              from some other type of item, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          is_active: Indicates whether this inventory assembly item is active. Inactive objects are
              typically hidden from views and reports in QuickBooks.

          lines: The inventory assembly item's lines.

          maximum_quantity_on_hand: The maximum quantity of this inventory assembly item desired in inventory.

          parent_id: The parent inventory assembly item one level above this one in the hierarchy.
              For example, if this inventory assembly item has a `fullName` of
              "Assemblies:Deluxe Kit", its parent has a `fullName` of "Assemblies". If this
              inventory assembly item is at the top level, this field will be `null`.

          preferred_vendor_id: The preferred vendor from whom this inventory assembly item is typically
              purchased.

          purchase_cost: The cost at which this inventory assembly item is purchased from vendors,
              represented as a decimal string.

          purchase_description: The description of this inventory assembly item that appears on purchase forms
              (e.g., checks, bills, item receipts) when it is ordered or bought from vendors.

          purchase_tax_code_id: The tax code applied to purchases of this inventory assembly item. Applicable in
              regions where purchase taxes are used, such as Canada or the UK.

          quantity_on_hand: The current quantity of this inventory assembly item available in inventory. To
              change the `quantityOnHand` for an inventory assembly item, you must create an
              inventory-adjustment instead of updating this inventory assembly item directly.

          sales_description: The description of this inventory assembly item that appears on sales forms
              (e.g., invoices, sales receipts) when sold to customers.

          sales_price: The price at which this inventory assembly item is sold to customers,
              represented as a decimal string.

          sales_tax_code_id: The sales-tax code associated with this inventory assembly item, determining
              whether it is taxable or non-taxable. It's used to assign a default tax status
              to all transactions for this inventory assembly item. Default codes include
              "Non" (non-taxable) and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes can also be created in
              QuickBooks. If QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales tax (via the "Do You
              Charge Sales Tax?" preference), it will assign the default non-taxable code to
              all sales.

          total_value: The total value of this inventory assembly item. If `totalValue` is provided,
              `quantityOnHand` must also be provided and must be greater than zero. If both
              `quantityOnHand` and `purchaseCost` are provided, then `totalValue` will be set
              to `quantityOnHand` times `purchaseCost`, regardless of what `totalValue` is
              explicitly set to.

          unit_of_measure_set_id: The unit-of-measure set associated with this inventory assembly item, which
              consists of a base unit and related units.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request

          timeout: Override the client-level default timeout for this request, in seconds

          income_account_id: The income account used to track revenue from sales of this inventory assembly
              item.

          is_active: Indicates whether this inventory assembly item is active. Inactive objects are
              typically hidden from views and reports in QuickBooks.

          lines: The inventory assembly item's lines.

          maximum_quantity_on_hand: The maximum quantity of this inventory assembly item desired in inventory.

          name: The case-insensitive name of this inventory assembly item. Not guaranteed to be

              all sales.

          sku: The inventory assembly item's stock keeping unit (SKU), which is sometimes the
              manufacturer's part number.

          unit_of_measure_set_id: The unit-of-measure set associated with this inventory assembly item, which

              `true`, the income account will be updated in all historical transactions where
              this inventory assembly item appears. Be cautious with this setting as it

              within a closed accounting period. If not specified, QuickBooks will prompt the
              user to make this choice.

        Returns a list of inventory assembly items.

        Args:
          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          class_ids: Filter for inventory assembly items of these classes. A class is a way end-users
              can categorize inventory assembly items in QuickBooks.

          cursor: The pagination token to fetch the next set of results when paginating with the
              `limit` parameter. Retrieve this value from the `nextCursor` field in the
              previous response. If omitted, the API returns the first page of results.

          full_names: Filter for specific inventory assembly items by their full-name(s),
              case-insensitive. Like `id`, `fullName` is a unique identifier for an inventory
              assembly item, formed by by combining the names of its parent objects with its
              own `name`, separated by colons. For example, if an inventory assembly item is
              under "Assemblies" and has the `name` "Deluxe Kit", its `fullName` would be
              "Assemblies:Deluxe Kit".

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          ids: Filter for specific inventory assembly items by their QuickBooks-assigned unique
              identifier(s).

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return. Ranging from 1 to 150, defaults to 150.
              Use this parameter in conjunction with the `cursor` parameter to paginate
              through results. The response will include a `nextCursor` field, which can be
              used as the `cursor` parameter value in subsequent requests to fetch the next
              set of results.

          name_contains: Filter for inventory assembly items whose `name` contains this substring,
              case-insensitive. NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use
              `nameStartsWith` or `nameEndsWith`.

          name_ends_with: Filter for inventory assembly items whose `name` ends with this substring,
              case-insensitive. NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use
              `nameContains` or `nameStartsWith`.

          name_from: Filter for inventory assembly items whose `name` is alphabetically greater than
              or equal to this value.

          name_starts_with: Filter for inventory assembly items whose `name` starts with this substring,
              case-insensitive. NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use
              `nameContains` or `nameEndsWith`.

          name_to: Filter for inventory assembly items whose `name` is alphabetically less than or
              equal to this value.

          status: Filter for inventory assembly items that are active, inactive, or both.

          updated_after: Filter for inventory assembly items updated on or after this date and time, in
              ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD),
              the time is assumed to be 00:00:00 of that day.

              **WARNING**: Due to a known issue in QuickBooks Desktop, the `updatedAfter`
              parameter may not correctly filter inventory assembly items by their updated
              dates. To accurately retrieve the desired inventory assembly items, we recommend
              avoiding this parameter and instead fetching a broader dataset, then filtering
              the results locally using the `updatedAt` property.

          updated_before: Filter for inventory assembly items updated on or before this date and time, in
              ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD),
              the time is assumed to be 23:59:59 of that day.

              **WARNING**: Due to a known issue in QuickBooks Desktop, the `updatedBefore`
              parameter may not correctly filter inventory assembly items by their updated
              dates. To accurately retrieve the desired inventory assembly items, we recommend
              avoiding this parameter and instead fetching a broader dataset, then filtering
              the results locally using the `updatedAt` property.

        Creates a new inventory assembly item.

        Args:
          asset_account_id: The asset account used to track the current value of this inventory assembly
              item in inventory.

          cogs_account_id: The Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) account for this inventory assembly item, tracking
              the original direct costs of producing goods sold.

          income_account_id: The income account used to track revenue from sales of this inventory assembly
              item.

          name: The case-insensitive name of this inventory assembly item. Not guaranteed to be
              unique because it does not include the names of its hierarchical parent objects
              like `fullName` does. For example, two inventory assembly items could both have
              the `name` "Deluxe Kit", but they could have unique `fullName` values, such as
              "Assemblies:Deluxe Kit" and "Inventory:Deluxe Kit". Maximum length: 31
              characters.

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          barcode: The inventory assembly item's barcode.

          build_notification_threshold: The inventory assembly item's minimum quantity threshold that triggers a build
              notification in QuickBooks. When the sum of `quantityOnHand` (current inventory)
              and `quantityOnOrder` (pending purchase orders) drops below this threshold,
              QuickBooks will notify users that more units need to be built or assembled. This
              helps ensure adequate inventory levels for inventory assembly items.

          class_id: The inventory assembly item's class. Classes can be used to categorize objects
              into meaningful segments, such as department, location, or type of work. In
              QuickBooks, class tracking is off by default.

          external_id: A globally unique identifier (GUID) you can provide for tracking this object in
              your external system.

              **IMPORTANT**: Must be formatted as a valid GUID; otherwise, QuickBooks will
              return an error. This field is immutable and can only be set during object
              creation.

          inventory_date: The date when this inventory assembly item was converted into an inventory item
              from some other type of item, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          is_active: Indicates whether this inventory assembly item is active. Inactive objects are
              typically hidden from views and reports in QuickBooks.

          lines: The inventory assembly item's lines.

          maximum_quantity_on_hand: The maximum quantity of this inventory assembly item desired in inventory.

          parent_id: The parent inventory assembly item one level above this one in the hierarchy.
              For example, if this inventory assembly item has a `fullName` of
              "Assemblies:Deluxe Kit", its parent has a `fullName` of "Assemblies". If this
              inventory assembly item is at the top level, this field will be `null`.

          preferred_vendor_id: The preferred vendor from whom this inventory assembly item is typically
              purchased.

          purchase_cost: The cost at which this inventory assembly item is purchased from vendors,
              represented as a decimal string.

          purchase_description: The description of this inventory assembly item that appears on purchase forms
              (e.g., checks, bills, item receipts) when it is ordered or bought from vendors.

          purchase_tax_code_id: The tax code applied to purchases of this inventory assembly item. Applicable in
              regions where purchase taxes are used, such as Canada or the UK.

          quantity_on_hand: The current quantity of this inventory assembly item available in inventory. To
              change the `quantityOnHand` for an inventory assembly item, you must create an
              inventory-adjustment instead of updating this inventory assembly item directly.

          sales_description: The description of this inventory assembly item that appears on sales forms
              (e.g., invoices, sales receipts) when sold to customers.

          sales_price: The price at which this inventory assembly item is sold to customers,
              represented as a decimal string.

          sales_tax_code_id: The sales-tax code associated with this inventory assembly item, determining
              whether it is taxable or non-taxable. It's used to assign a default tax status
              to all transactions for this inventory assembly item. Default codes include
              "Non" (non-taxable) and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes can also be created in
              QuickBooks. If QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales tax (via the "Do You
              Charge Sales Tax?" preference), it will assign the default non-taxable code to
              all sales.

          total_value: The total value of this inventory assembly item. If `totalValue` is provided,
              `quantityOnHand` must also be provided and must be greater than zero. If both
              `quantityOnHand` and `purchaseCost` are provided, then `totalValue` will be set
              to `quantityOnHand` times `purchaseCost`, regardless of what `totalValue` is
              explicitly set to.

          unit_of_measure_set_id: The unit-of-measure set associated with this inventory assembly item, which
              consists of a base unit and related units.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

        Updates an existing inventory assembly item.

        Args:
          id: The QuickBooks-assigned unique identifier of the inventory assembly item to
              update.

          revision_number: The current revision number of the inventory assembly item object you are
              updating, which you can get by fetching the object first. Provide the most
              recent `revisionNumber` to ensure you're working with the latest data;
              otherwise, the update will return an error.

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          asset_account_id: The asset account used to track the current value of this inventory assembly
              item in inventory.

          barcode: The inventory assembly item's barcode.

          build_notification_threshold: The inventory assembly item's minimum quantity threshold that triggers a build
              notification in QuickBooks. When the sum of `quantityOnHand` (current inventory)
              and `quantityOnOrder` (pending purchase orders) drops below this threshold,
              QuickBooks will notify users that more units need to be built or assembled. This
              helps ensure adequate inventory levels for inventory assembly items.

          class_id: The inventory assembly item's class. Classes can be used to categorize objects
              into meaningful segments, such as department, location, or type of work. In
              QuickBooks, class tracking is off by default.

          clear_item_lines: When `true`, removes all existing item lines associated with this inventory
              assembly item. To modify or add individual item lines, use the field `itemLines`
              instead.

          cogs_account_id: The Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) account for this inventory assembly item, tracking
              the original direct costs of producing goods sold.

          force_unit_of_measure_change: Indicates whether to allow changing the inventory assembly item's
              unit-of-measure set (using the `unitOfMeasureSetId` field) when the base unit of
              the new unit-of-measure set does not match that of the currently assigned set.
              Without setting this field to `true` in this scenario, the request will fail
              with an error; hence, this field is equivalent to accepting the warning prompt
              in the QuickBooks UI.

              NOTE: Changing the base unit requires you to update the item's
              quantities-on-hand and cost to reflect the new unit; otherwise, these values
              will be inaccurate. Alternatively, consider creating a new item with the desired
              unit-of-measure set and deactivating the old item.

          income_account_id: The income account used to track revenue from sales of this inventory assembly
              item.

          is_active: Indicates whether this inventory assembly item is active. Inactive objects are
              typically hidden from views and reports in QuickBooks.

          lines: The inventory assembly item's lines.

          maximum_quantity_on_hand: The maximum quantity of this inventory assembly item desired in inventory.

          name: The case-insensitive name of this inventory assembly item. Not guaranteed to be
              unique because it does not include the names of its hierarchical parent objects
              like `fullName` does. For example, two inventory assembly items could both have
              the `name` "Deluxe Kit", but they could have unique `fullName` values, such as
              "Assemblies:Deluxe Kit" and "Inventory:Deluxe Kit". Maximum length: 31
              characters.

          parent_id: The parent inventory assembly item one level above this one in the hierarchy.
              For example, if this inventory assembly item has a `fullName` of
              "Assemblies:Deluxe Kit", its parent has a `fullName` of "Assemblies". If this
              inventory assembly item is at the top level, this field will be `null`.

          preferred_vendor_id: The preferred vendor from whom this inventory assembly item is typically
              purchased.

          purchase_cost: The cost at which this inventory assembly item is purchased from vendors,
              represented as a decimal string.

          purchase_description: The description of this inventory assembly item that appears on purchase forms
              (e.g., checks, bills, item receipts) when it is ordered or bought from vendors.

          purchase_tax_code_id: The tax code applied to purchases of this inventory assembly item. Applicable in
              regions where purchase taxes are used, such as Canada or the UK.

          sales_description: The description of this inventory assembly item that appears on sales forms
              (e.g., invoices, sales receipts) when sold to customers.

          sales_price: The price at which this inventory assembly item is sold to customers,
              represented as a decimal string.

          sales_tax_code_id: The sales-tax code associated with this inventory assembly item, determining
              whether it is taxable or non-taxable. It's used to assign a default tax status
              to all transactions for this inventory assembly item. Default codes include
              "Non" (non-taxable) and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes can also be created in
              QuickBooks. If QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales tax (via the "Do You
              Charge Sales Tax?" preference), it will assign the default non-taxable code to
              all sales.

          sku: The inventory assembly item's stock keeping unit (SKU), which is sometimes the
              manufacturer's part number.

          unit_of_measure_set_id: The unit-of-measure set associated with this inventory assembly item, which
              consists of a base unit and related units.

          update_existing_transactions_income_account: When `true`, applies the new income account (specified by the `incomeAccountId`
              field) to all existing transactions that use this inventory assembly item. If
              `true`, the income account will be updated in all historical transactions where
              this inventory assembly item appears. Be cautious with this setting as it
              modifies historical data. The update will fail if any affected transactions fall
              within a closed accounting period. If not specified, QuickBooks will prompt the
              user to make this choice.

              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          class_ids: Filter for inventory assembly items of these classes. A class is a way end-users
              can categorize inventory assembly items in QuickBooks.

          cursor: The pagination token to fetch the next set of results when paginating with the
              `limit` parameter. Retrieve this value from the `nextCursor` field in the
              previous response. If omitted, the API returns the first page of results.

          full_names: Filter for specific inventory assembly items by their full-name(s),
              case-insensitive. Like `id`, `fullName` is a unique identifier for an inventory
              assembly item, formed by by combining the names of its parent objects with its
              own `name`, separated by colons. For example, if an inventory assembly item is
              under "Assemblies" and has the `name` "Deluxe Kit", its `fullName` would be
              "Assemblies:Deluxe Kit".

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          ids: Filter for specific inventory assembly items by their QuickBooks-assigned unique
              identifier(s).

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return. Ranging from 1 to 150, defaults to 150.
              Use this parameter in conjunction with the `cursor` parameter to paginate
              through results. The response will include a `nextCursor` field, which can be
              used as the `cursor` parameter value in subsequent requests to fetch the next
              set of results.

          name_contains: Filter for inventory assembly items whose `name` contains this substring,
              case-insensitive. NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use
              `nameStartsWith` or `nameEndsWith`.

          name_ends_with: Filter for inventory assembly items whose `name` ends with this substring,
              case-insensitive. NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use
              `nameContains` or `nameStartsWith`.

          name_from: Filter for inventory assembly items whose `name` is alphabetically greater than
              or equal to this value.

          name_starts_with: Filter for inventory assembly items whose `name` starts with this substring,
              case-insensitive. NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use
              `nameContains` or `nameEndsWith`.

          name_to: Filter for inventory assembly items whose `name` is alphabetically less than or
              equal to this value.

          status: Filter for inventory assembly items that are active, inactive, or both.

          updated_after: Filter for inventory assembly items updated on or after this date and time, in
              ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD),
              the time is assumed to be 00:00:00 of that day.

              **WARNING**: Due to a known issue in QuickBooks Desktop, the `updatedAfter`
              parameter may not correctly filter inventory assembly items by their updated
              dates. To accurately retrieve the desired inventory assembly items, we recommend
              avoiding this parameter and instead fetching a broader dataset, then filtering
              the results locally using the `updatedAt` property.

          updated_before: Filter for inventory assembly items updated on or before this date and time, in
              ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD),
              the time is assumed to be 23:59:59 of that day.
