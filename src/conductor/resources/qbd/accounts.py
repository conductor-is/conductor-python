        Creates a financial account.

        Args:
          account_type: The classification of this account, indicating its purpose within the chart of
              accounts. You cannot create an account of type "non_posting" through the API
              because QuickBooks creates these accounts behind the scenes.

          name: The case-insensitive name of this account. Not guaranteed to be unique because
              it does not include the names of its parent objects like `fullName` does. For
              example, two accounts could both have the `name` "Accounts-Payable", but they
              could have unique `fullName` values, such as "Corporate:Accounts-Payable" and
              "Finance:Accounts-Payable". Maximum length: 31 characters.

              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          account_number: The account's account number, which appears in the QuickBooks chart of accounts,
              reports, and graphs. Note that if the "Use Account Numbers" preference is turned
              off in QuickBooks, the account number may not be visible in the user interface,
              but it can still be set and retrieved through the API.

          bank_account_number: The bank account number or identifying note for this account. Access to this
              field may be restricted based on permissions.

          currency_id: The account's currency. For built-in currencies, the name and code are standard
              international values. For user-defined currencies, all values are editable.

          description: A description of this account.

          is_active: Indicates whether this account is active. Inactive objects are typically hidden
              from views and reports in QuickBooks.

          opening_balance: The amount of money in, or the value of, this account as of
              `openingBalanceDate`. On a bank statement, this would be the amount of money in
              the account at the beginning of the statement period.

          opening_balance_date: The date of the opening balance of this account, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD).

          parent_id: The parent account one level above this one in the hierarchy. For example, if
              this account has a `fullName` of "Corporate:Accounts-Payable", its parent has a
              `fullName` of "Corporate". If this account is at the top level, this field will

          sales_tax_code_id: The sales-tax code associated with this account, determining whether
              transactions in this account are taxable or non-taxable. It's used to assign a
              default tax status to all transactions for this account. Default codes include
              "Non" (non-taxable) and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes can also be created in
              QuickBooks. If QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales tax (via the "Do You
              Charge Sales Tax?" preference), it will assign the default non-taxable code to
              all sales.

          tax_line_id: The identifier of the tax line associated with this account.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

              NOTE: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other query
              parameters.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return. NOTE: QuickBooks Desktop does not
              support cursor-based pagination for accounts. Hence, this parameter will limit
              the response size, but you will not be able to fetch the next set of results. To
              paginate through the results for this endpoint, try fetching batches via the
              name-range (e.g., `nameFrom=A&nameTo=B`) query parameters.

          name_contains: Filter for accounts whose `name` contains this substring, case-insensitive.
              NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameStartsWith` or
              `nameEndsWith`.

          name_ends_with: Filter for accounts whose `name` ends with this substring, case-insensitive.
              NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameContains` or
              `nameStartsWith`.

          name_from: Filter for accounts whose `name` is alphabetically greater than or equal to this
              value.

          name_starts_with: Filter for accounts whose `name` starts with this substring, case-insensitive.
              NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameContains` or
              `nameEndsWith`.

          name_to: Filter for accounts whose `name` is alphabetically less than or equal to this
              value.

          status: Filter for accounts that are active, inactive, or both.

          updated_after: Filter for accounts updated on or after this date and time, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time is
              assumed to be 00:00:00 of that day.

          updated_before: Filter for accounts updated on or before this date and time, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time is
              assumed to be 23:59:59 of that day.

              accounts. You cannot create an account of type "non_posting" through the API
              because QuickBooks creates these accounts behind the scenes.

          name: The case-insensitive name of this account. Not guaranteed to be unique because
              it does not include the names of its parent objects like `fullName` does. For
              example, two accounts could both have the `name` "Accounts-Payable", but they
              could have unique `fullName` values, such as "Corporate:Accounts-Payable" and
              "Finance:Accounts-Payable". Maximum length: 31 characters.

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

              off in QuickBooks, the account number may not be visible in the user interface,
              but it can still be set and retrieved through the API.

          bank_account_number: The bank account number or identifying note for this account. Access to this
              field may be restricted based on permissions.

          currency_id: The account's currency. For built-in currencies, the name and code are standard
              international values. For user-defined currencies, all values are editable.

          description: A description of this account.

          is_active: Indicates whether this account is active. Inactive objects are typically hidden
              from views and reports in QuickBooks.

          opening_balance: The amount of money in, or the value of, this account as of
              `openingBalanceDate`. On a bank statement, this would be the amount of money in
              the account at the beginning of the statement period.

          opening_balance_date: The date of the opening balance of this account, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD).

          parent_id: The parent account one level above this one in the hierarchy. For example, if
              this account has a `fullName` of "Corporate:Accounts-Payable", its parent has a

          sales_tax_code_id: The sales-tax code associated with this account, determining whether
              transactions in this account are taxable or non-taxable. It's used to assign a
              default tax status to all transactions for this account. Default codes include
              "Non" (non-taxable) and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes can also be created in
              QuickBooks. If QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales tax (via the "Do You
              Charge Sales Tax?" preference), it will assign the default non-taxable code to
              all sales.

        Returns a list of accounts.

        Args:
          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          account_type: Filter for accounts of this type.

          currency_ids: Filter for accounts in this currency or currencies.

          full_names: Filter for specific accounts by their full-name(s), case-insensitive. Like `id`,
              `fullName` is a unique identifier for an account, formed by by combining the
              names of its parent objects with its own `name`, separated by colons. For
              example, if an account is under "Expenses:Utilities" and has the `name`
              "Electricity", its `fullName` would be "Expenses:Utilities:Electricity".

              Unlike `name`, `fullName` is guaranteed to be unique across all account objects.
              Also, unlike `id`, `fullName` can be arbitrarily changed by the QuickBooks user
              when modifying its underlying `name` field.

              NOTE: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other query
              parameters.

          ids: Filter for specific accounts by their QuickBooks-assigned unique identifier(s).

              NOTE: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other query
              parameters.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return. NOTE: QuickBooks Desktop does not
              support cursor-based pagination for accounts. Hence, this parameter will limit
              the response size, but you will not be able to fetch the next set of results. To
              paginate through the results for this endpoint, try fetching batches via the
              name-range (e.g., `nameFrom=A&nameTo=B`) query parameters.

          name_contains: Filter for accounts whose `name` contains this substring, case-insensitive.
              NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameStartsWith` or
              `nameEndsWith`.

          name_ends_with: Filter for accounts whose `name` ends with this substring, case-insensitive.
              NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameContains` or
              `nameStartsWith`.

          name_from: Filter for accounts whose `name` is alphabetically greater than or equal to this
              value.

          name_starts_with: Filter for accounts whose `name` starts with this substring, case-insensitive.
              NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameContains` or
              `nameEndsWith`.

          name_to: Filter for accounts whose `name` is alphabetically less than or equal to this
              value.

          status: Filter for accounts that are active, inactive, or both.

          updated_after: Filter for accounts updated on or after this date and time, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time is
              assumed to be 00:00:00 of that day.

          updated_before: Filter for accounts updated on or before this date and time, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time is
              assumed to be 23:59:59 of that day.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request

          timeout: Override the client-level default timeout for this request, in seconds
