        Creates a new receive-payment.

        Args:
          customer_id: The customer or customer-job to which the payment for this receive-payment is
              credited.

          total_amount: The total monetary amount of this receive-payment, represented as a decimal
              string.

              **NOTE:** The sum of the `paymentAmount` amounts in the `applyToTransactions`
              array cannot exceed the `totalAmount`, or you will receive an error.

          transaction_date: The date of this receive-payment, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          apply_to_transactions: The invoices to be paid by this receive-payment. This will create a link between
              this receive-payment and the specified invoices.

              **IMPORTANT**: In each `applyToTransactions` object, you must specify either
              `paymentAmount`, `applyCredits`, `discountAmount`, or any combination of these;
              if none of these are specified, you will receive an error for an empty
              transaction.

              **IMPORTANT**: The target invoice must have `isPaid=false`, otherwise,
              QuickBooks will report this object as "cannot be found".

              **NOTE**: You must specify either `isAutoApply` or `applyToTransactions` when
              creating a receive-payment, but never both.

          credit_card_transaction: The credit card transaction data for this receive-payment's payment when using
              QuickBooks Merchant Services (QBMS). If specifying this field, you must also
              specify the `paymentMethod` field.

          deposit_to_account_id: The account where the funds for this receive-payment will be or have been
              deposited. If omitted, QuickBooks will use the default Undeposited Funds
              account.

          exchange_rate: The market exchange rate between this receive-payment's currency and the home
              currency in QuickBooks at the time of this transaction. Represented as a decimal
              value (e.g., 1.2345 for 1 EUR = 1.2345 USD if USD is the home currency).

          external_id: A globally unique identifier (GUID) you can provide for tracking this object in
              your external system.

              **IMPORTANT**: Must be formatted as a valid GUID; otherwise, QuickBooks will
              return an error. This field is immutable and can only be set during object
              creation.

          is_auto_apply: When `true`, QuickBooks applies `totalAmount` to any outstanding transaction
              that exactly matches `totalAmount`. If no exact match is found, this
              receive-payment is applied to the oldest outstanding transaction for the
              customer-job. When `false`, QuickBooks records the payment but does not apply it
              to any specific transaction, causing the amount to appear as a credit on the
              customer-jobâ€™s next transaction.

              **IMPORTANT**: You must specify either `isAutoApply` or `applyToTransactions`
              when creating a receive-payment, but never both.

          memo: A memo or note that appears in reports that show details of this
              receive-payment.

          payment_method_id: The receive-payment's payment method (e.g., cash, check, credit card).

              **NOTE**: If this receive-payment contains credit card transaction data supplied
              from QuickBooks Merchant Services (QBMS) transaction responses, you must specify
              a credit card payment method (e.g., "Visa", "MasterCard", etc.).

          receivables_account_id: The Accounts-Receivable (A/R) account to which this receive-payment is assigned,
              used to track the amount owed. If not specified, QuickBooks Desktop will use its
              default A/R account.

              **IMPORTANT**: If this receive-payment is linked to other transactions, this A/R
              account must match the `receivablesAccount` used in all linked transactions. For
              example, when refunding a credit card payment, the A/R account must match the
              one used in the original credit transactions being refunded.

          ref_number: The case-sensitive user-defined reference number for this receive-payment, which
              can be used to identify the transaction in QuickBooks. This value is not
              required to be unique and can be arbitrarily changed by the QuickBooks user.

              `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_ends_with: Filter for receive-payments whose `refNumber` ends with this substring. NOTE: If
              you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberStartsWith`.

          ref_number_from: Filter for receive-payments whose `refNumber` is greater than or equal to this
              value. If omitted, the range will begin with the first number of the list. Uses
              a numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.

          ref_numbers: Filter for specific receive-payments by their ref-number(s), case-sensitive. In
              QuickBooks, ref-numbers are not required to be unique and can be arbitrarily
              changed by the QuickBooks user.

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          ref_number_starts_with:
              Filter for receive-payments whose `refNumber` starts with this substring. NOTE:
              If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_to: Filter for receive-payments whose `refNumber` is less than or equal to this
              value. If omitted, the range will end with the last number of the list. Uses a
              numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.

          transaction_date_from: Filter for receive-payments created on or after this date, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD).

          transaction_date_to: Filter for receive-payments created on or before this date, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD).

          updated_after: Filter for receive-payments updated on or after this date and time, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time
              is assumed to be 00:00:00 of that day.

          updated_before: Filter for receive-payments updated on or before this date and time, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time
              is assumed to be 23:59:59 of that day.

        Creates a new receive-payment.

        Args:
          customer_id: The customer or customer-job to which the payment for this receive-payment is
              credited.

          total_amount: The total monetary amount of this receive-payment, represented as a decimal
              string.

              **NOTE:** The sum of the `paymentAmount` amounts in the `applyToTransactions`
              array cannot exceed the `totalAmount`, or you will receive an error.

          transaction_date: The date of this receive-payment, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          apply_to_transactions: The invoices to be paid by this receive-payment. This will create a link between
              this receive-payment and the specified invoices.

              **IMPORTANT**: In each `applyToTransactions` object, you must specify either
              `paymentAmount`, `applyCredits`, `discountAmount`, or any combination of these;
              if none of these are specified, you will receive an error for an empty
              transaction.

              **IMPORTANT**: The target invoice must have `isPaid=false`, otherwise,
              QuickBooks will report this object as "cannot be found".

              **NOTE**: You must specify either `isAutoApply` or `applyToTransactions` when
              creating a receive-payment, but never both.

          credit_card_transaction: The credit card transaction data for this receive-payment's payment when using
              QuickBooks Merchant Services (QBMS). If specifying this field, you must also
              specify the `paymentMethod` field.

          deposit_to_account_id: The account where the funds for this receive-payment will be or have been
              deposited. If omitted, QuickBooks will use the default Undeposited Funds
              account.

          exchange_rate: The market exchange rate between this receive-payment's currency and the home
              currency in QuickBooks at the time of this transaction. Represented as a decimal
              value (e.g., 1.2345 for 1 EUR = 1.2345 USD if USD is the home currency).

          external_id: A globally unique identifier (GUID) you can provide for tracking this object in
              your external system.

              **IMPORTANT**: Must be formatted as a valid GUID; otherwise, QuickBooks will
              return an error. This field is immutable and can only be set during object
              creation.

          is_auto_apply: When `true`, QuickBooks applies `totalAmount` to any outstanding transaction
              that exactly matches `totalAmount`. If no exact match is found, this
              receive-payment is applied to the oldest outstanding transaction for the
              customer-job. When `false`, QuickBooks records the payment but does not apply it
              to any specific transaction, causing the amount to appear as a credit on the
              customer-jobâ€™s next transaction.

              **IMPORTANT**: You must specify either `isAutoApply` or `applyToTransactions`
              when creating a receive-payment, but never both.

          memo: A memo or note that appears in reports that show details of this
              receive-payment.

          payment_method_id: The receive-payment's payment method (e.g., cash, check, credit card).

              **NOTE**: If this receive-payment contains credit card transaction data supplied
              from QuickBooks Merchant Services (QBMS) transaction responses, you must specify
              a credit card payment method (e.g., "Visa", "MasterCard", etc.).

          receivables_account_id: The Accounts-Receivable (A/R) account to which this receive-payment is assigned,
              used to track the amount owed. If not specified, QuickBooks Desktop will use its
              default A/R account.

              **IMPORTANT**: If this receive-payment is linked to other transactions, this A/R
              account must match the `receivablesAccount` used in all linked transactions. For
              example, when refunding a credit card payment, the A/R account must match the
              one used in the original credit transactions being refunded.

          ref_number: The case-sensitive user-defined reference number for this receive-payment, which
              can be used to identify the transaction in QuickBooks. This value is not
              required to be unique and can be arbitrarily changed by the QuickBooks user.

        Returns a list of receive-payments.

        Use the `cursor` parameter to paginate through the results.

        Args:
          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          account_ids: Filter for receive-payments associated with these accounts.

          currency_ids: Filter for receive-payments in these currencies.

          cursor: The pagination token to fetch the next set of results when paginating with the
              `limit` parameter. Retrieve this value from the `nextCursor` field in the
              previous response. If omitted, the API returns the first page of results.

          customer_ids: Filter for receive-payments received from these customers.

          ids: Filter for specific receive-payments by their QuickBooks-assigned unique
              identifier(s).

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          include_line_items: Whether to include line items in the response. Defaults to `true`.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return. Ranging from 1 to 150, defaults to 150.
              Use this parameter in conjunction with the `cursor` parameter to paginate
              through results. The response will include a `nextCursor` field, which can be
              used as the `cursor` parameter value in subsequent requests to fetch the next
              set of results.

          ref_number_contains: Filter for receive-payments whose `refNumber` contains this substring. NOTE: If
              you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberStartsWith` or
              `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_ends_with: Filter for receive-payments whose `refNumber` ends with this substring. NOTE: If
              you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberStartsWith`.

          ref_number_from: Filter for receive-payments whose `refNumber` is greater than or equal to this
              value. If omitted, the range will begin with the first number of the list. Uses
              a numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.

          ref_numbers: Filter for specific receive-payments by their ref-number(s), case-sensitive. In
              QuickBooks, ref-numbers are not required to be unique and can be arbitrarily
              changed by the QuickBooks user.

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          ref_number_starts_with:
              Filter for receive-payments whose `refNumber` starts with this substring. NOTE:
              If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_to: Filter for receive-payments whose `refNumber` is less than or equal to this
              value. If omitted, the range will end with the last number of the list. Uses a
              numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.

          transaction_date_from: Filter for receive-payments created on or after this date, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD).

          transaction_date_to: Filter for receive-payments created on or before this date, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD).

          updated_after: Filter for receive-payments updated on or after this date and time, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time
              is assumed to be 00:00:00 of that day.

          updated_before: Filter for receive-payments updated on or before this date and time, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time
              is assumed to be 23:59:59 of that day.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request
