        Creates a new sales receipt.

        Args:
          customer_id: The customer or customer-job to which the payment for this sales receipt is
              credited.

          transaction_date: The date of this sales receipt, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          billing_address: The sales receipt's billing address.

          check_number: The check number of a check received for this sales receipt.

          class_id: The sales receipt's class. Classes can be used to categorize objects into
              meaningful segments, such as department, location, or type of work. In
              QuickBooks, class tracking is off by default. A class defined here is
              automatically used in this sales receipt's line items unless overridden at the
              line item level.

          credit_card_transaction: The credit card transaction data for this sales receipt's payment when using
              QuickBooks Merchant Services (QBMS). If specifying this field, you must also
              specify the `paymentMethod` field.

          customer_message_id: The message to display to the customer on the sales receipt.

          deposit_to_account_id: The account where the funds for this sales receipt will be or have been
              deposited.

          document_template_id: The predefined template in QuickBooks that determines the layout and formatting
              for this sales receipt when printed or displayed.

          due_date: The date by which this sales receipt must be paid, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD).

              **NOTE:** For sales receipts, this field is often `null` because sales receipts
              are generally used for point-of-sale payments, where full payment is received at
              the time of purchase.

          exchange_rate: The market exchange rate between this sales receipt's currency and the home
              currency in QuickBooks at the time of this transaction. Represented as a decimal
              value (e.g., 1.2345 for 1 EUR = 1.2345 USD if USD is the home currency).

          external_id: A globally unique identifier (GUID) you can provide for tracking this object in
              your external system.

              **IMPORTANT**: Must be formatted as a valid GUID; otherwise, QuickBooks will
              return an error. This field is immutable and can only be set during object
              creation.

          is_pending: Indicates whether this sales receipt has not been completed.

          is_queued_for_email: Indicates whether this sales receipt is included in the queue of documents for
              QuickBooks to email to the customer.

          is_queued_for_print: Indicates whether this sales receipt is included in the queue of documents for
              QuickBooks to print.

          line_groups: The sales receipt's line item groups, each representing a predefined set of
              related items.

              **IMPORTANT**: You must specify `lines`, `lineGroups`, or both when creating a
              sales receipt.

          lines: The sales receipt's line items, each representing a single product or service
              sold.

              **IMPORTANT**: You must specify `lines`, `lineGroups`, or both when creating a
              sales receipt.

          memo: A memo or note for this sales receipt that appears in reports, but not on the
              sales receipt.

          other_custom_field: A built-in custom field for additional information specific to this sales
              receipt. Unlike the user-defined fields in the `customFields` array, this is a
              standard QuickBooks field that exists for all sales receipts for convenience.
              Developers often use this field for tracking information that doesn't fit into
              other standard QuickBooks fields. Unlike `otherCustomField1` and
              `otherCustomField2`, which are line item fields, this exists at the transaction
              level. Hidden by default in the QuickBooks UI.

          payment_method_id: The sales receipt's payment method (e.g., cash, check, credit card).

              **NOTE**: If this sales receipt contains credit card transaction data supplied
              from QuickBooks Merchant Services (QBMS) transaction responses, you must specify
              a credit card payment method (e.g., "Visa", "MasterCard", etc.).

          ref_number: The case-sensitive user-defined reference number for this sales receipt, which
              can be used to identify the transaction in QuickBooks. This value is not
              required to be unique and can be arbitrarily changed by the QuickBooks user.

          sales_representative_id: The sales receipt's sales representative. Sales representatives can be
              employees, vendors, or other names in QuickBooks.

          sales_tax_code_id: The sales-tax code for items sold to the `customer` of this sales receipt,
              determining whether items sold to this customer are taxable or non-taxable.
              Default codes include "Non" (non-taxable) and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes
              can also be created in QuickBooks. If QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales
              tax (via the "Do You Charge Sales Tax?" preference), it will assign the default
              non-taxable code to all sales.

          sales_tax_item_id: The sales-tax item used to calculate the actual tax amount for this sales
              receipt's transactions by applying a specific tax rate collected for a single
              tax agency. Unlike `salesTaxCode`, which only indicates general taxability, this
              field drives the actual tax calculation and reporting.

              For sales receipts, while using this field to specify a single tax item/group
              that applies uniformly is recommended, complex tax scenarios may require
              alternative approaches. In such cases, you can set this field to a 0% tax item
              (conventionally named "Tax Calculated On Invoice") and handle tax calculations
              through line items instead. When using line items for taxes, note that only
              individual tax items (not tax groups) can be used, subtotals can help apply a
              tax to multiple items but only the first tax line after a subtotal is calculated
              automatically (subsequent tax lines require manual amounts), and the rate column
              will always display the actual tax amount rather than the rate percentage.

          shipment_origin: The origin location from where the product associated with this sales receipt is
              shipped. This is the point at which ownership and liability for goods transfer
              from seller to buyer. Internally, QuickBooks uses the term "FOB" for this field,
              which stands for "freight on board". This field is informational and has no
              accounting implications.

          shipping_address: The sales receipt's shipping address.

          shipping_date: The date when the products or services for this sales receipt were shipped or
              are expected to be shipped, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          shipping_method_id: The shipping method used for this sales receipt, such as standard mail or
              overnight delivery.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request

          timeout: Override the client-level default timeout for this request, in seconds

              have not changed. Any line item groups not included will be removed. To add a
              new line item group, include it with its `id` set to `-1`. If you do not wish to
              modify the line item groups, you can omit this field entirely to keep them
              unchanged.

          lines: The sales receipt's line items, each representing a single product or service
              sold.

              **IMPORTANT**: When updating a sales receipt's line items, this array completely
              REPLACES all existing line items for that sales receipt. To retain any current
              line items, include them in this array, even if they have not changed. Any line
              items not included will be removed. To add a new line item, include it with its
              `id` set to `-1`. If you do not wish to modify the line items, you can omit this
              field entirely to keep them unchanged.

          memo: A memo or note for this sales receipt that appears in reports, but not on the
              sales receipt.

          other_custom_field: A built-in custom field for additional information specific to this sales
              receipt. Unlike the user-defined fields in the `customFields` array, this is a
              standard QuickBooks field that exists for all sales receipts for convenience.
              Developers often use this field for tracking information that doesn't fit into
              other standard QuickBooks fields. Unlike `otherCustomField1` and
              `otherCustomField2`, which are line item fields, this exists at the transaction
              level. Hidden by default in the QuickBooks UI.

          payment_method_id: The sales receipt's payment method (e.g., cash, check, credit card).

          ref_number: The case-sensitive user-defined reference number for this sales receipt, which
              can be used to identify the transaction in QuickBooks. This value is not
              required to be unique and can be arbitrarily changed by the QuickBooks user.

          sales_representative_id: The sales receipt's sales representative. Sales representatives can be
              employees, vendors, or other names in QuickBooks.

          sales_tax_code_id: The sales-tax code for items sold to the `customer` of this sales receipt,
              determining whether items sold to this customer are taxable or non-taxable.
              Default codes include "Non" (non-taxable) and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes
              can also be created in QuickBooks. If QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales
              tax (via the "Do You Charge Sales Tax?" preference), it will assign the default
              non-taxable code to all sales.

          sales_tax_item_id: The sales-tax item used to calculate the actual tax amount for this sales
              receipt's transactions by applying a specific tax rate collected for a single
              tax agency. Unlike `salesTaxCode`, which only indicates general taxability, this
              field drives the actual tax calculation and reporting.

              For sales receipts, while using this field to specify a single tax item/group
              that applies uniformly is recommended, complex tax scenarios may require
              alternative approaches. In such cases, you can set this field to a 0% tax item
              (conventionally named "Tax Calculated On Invoice") and handle tax calculations
              through line items instead. When using line items for taxes, note that only
              individual tax items (not tax groups) can be used, subtotals can help apply a
              tax to multiple items but only the first tax line after a subtotal is calculated
              automatically (subsequent tax lines require manual amounts), and the rate column
              will always display the actual tax amount rather than the rate percentage.

          shipment_origin: The origin location from where the product associated with this sales receipt is
              shipped. This is the point at which ownership and liability for goods transfer
              from seller to buyer. Internally, QuickBooks uses the term "FOB" for this field,
              which stands for "freight on board". This field is informational and has no
              accounting implications.

          shipping_address: The sales receipt's shipping address.

          shipping_date: The date when the products or services for this sales receipt were shipped or
              are expected to be shipped, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          shipping_method_id: The shipping method used for this sales receipt, such as standard mail or
              overnight delivery.

          transaction_date: The date of this sales receipt, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

        Args:
          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          account_ids: Filter for sales receipts associated with these accounts.

          currency_ids: Filter for sales receipts in these currencies.

          cursor: The pagination token to fetch the next set of results when paginating with the
              `limit` parameter. Retrieve this value from the `nextCursor` field in the
              previous response. If omitted, the API returns the first page of results.

          customer_ids: Filter for sales receipts created for these customers.

          ids: Filter for specific sales receipts by their QuickBooks-assigned unique
              identifier(s).

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          include_line_items: Whether to include line items in the response. Defaults to `true`.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return. Accepts values ranging from 1 to 150,
              defaults to 150. When used with cursor-based pagination, this parameter controls
              how many results are returned per page. To paginate through results, combine
              this with the `cursor` parameter. Each response will include a `nextCursor`
              value that can be passed to subsequent requests to retrieve the next page of
              results.

          ref_number_contains: Filter for sales receipts whose `refNumber` contains this substring. NOTE: If
              you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberStartsWith` or
              `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_ends_with: Filter for sales receipts whose `refNumber` ends with this substring. NOTE: If
              you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberStartsWith`.

          ref_number_from: Filter for sales receipts whose `refNumber` is greater than or equal to this
              value. If omitted, the range will begin with the first number of the list. Uses
              a numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.

          ref_numbers: Filter for specific sales receipts by their ref-number(s), case-sensitive. In
              QuickBooks, ref-numbers are not required to be unique and can be arbitrarily
              changed by the QuickBooks user.

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          ref_number_starts_with: Filter for sales receipts whose `refNumber` starts with this substring. NOTE: If
              you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_to: Filter for sales receipts whose `refNumber` is less than or equal to this value.
              If omitted, the range will end with the last number of the list. Uses a
              numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.

          transaction_date_from: Filter for sales receipts created on or after this date, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD).

          transaction_date_to: Filter for sales receipts created on or before this date, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD).

          updated_after: Filter for sales receipts updated on or after this date and time, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time
              is assumed to be 00:00:00 of that day.

          updated_before: Filter for sales receipts updated on or before this date and time, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time

              **NOTE:** For sales receipts, this field is often `null` because sales receipts
              are generally used for point-of-sale payments, where full payment is received at
              the time of purchase.

          exchange_rate: The market exchange rate between this sales receipt's currency and the home
              currency in QuickBooks at the time of this transaction. Represented as a decimal
              value (e.g., 1.2345 for 1 EUR = 1.2345 USD if USD is the home currency).

          external_id: A globally unique identifier (GUID) you can provide for tracking this object in
              your external system.

              **IMPORTANT**: Must be formatted as a valid GUID; otherwise, QuickBooks will
              return an error. This field is immutable and can only be set during object
              creation.

          is_pending: Indicates whether this sales receipt has not been completed.

          is_queued_for_email: Indicates whether this sales receipt is included in the queue of documents for
              QuickBooks to email to the customer.

          is_queued_for_print: Indicates whether this sales receipt is included in the queue of documents for
              QuickBooks to print.

          line_groups: The sales receipt's line item groups, each representing a predefined set of
              related items.

              **IMPORTANT**: You must specify `lines`, `lineGroups`, or both when creating a
              sales receipt.

          lines: The sales receipt's line items, each representing a single product or service
              sold.

              **IMPORTANT**: You must specify `lines`, `lineGroups`, or both when creating a
              sales receipt.

          memo: A memo or note for this sales receipt that appears in reports, but not on the
              sales receipt.

          other_custom_field: A built-in custom field for additional information specific to this sales
              receipt. Unlike the user-defined fields in the `customFields` array, this is a
              standard QuickBooks field that exists for all sales receipts for convenience.
              Developers often use this field for tracking information that doesn't fit into
              other standard QuickBooks fields. Unlike `otherCustomField1` and
              `otherCustomField2`, which are line item fields, this exists at the transaction
              level. Hidden by default in the QuickBooks UI.

          payment_method_id: The sales receipt's payment method (e.g., cash, check, credit card).

              **NOTE**: If this sales receipt contains credit card transaction data supplied
              from QuickBooks Merchant Services (QBMS) transaction responses, you must specify
              a credit card payment method (e.g., "Visa", "MasterCard", etc.).

          ref_number: The case-sensitive user-defined reference number for this sales receipt, which
              can be used to identify the transaction in QuickBooks. This value is not
              required to be unique and can be arbitrarily changed by the QuickBooks user.

          sales_representative_id: The sales receipt's sales representative. Sales representatives can be
              employees, vendors, or other names in QuickBooks.

          sales_tax_code_id: The sales-tax code for items sold to the `customer` of this sales receipt,
              determining whether items sold to this customer are taxable or non-taxable.
              Default codes include "Non" (non-taxable) and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes
              can also be created in QuickBooks. If QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales
              tax (via the "Do You Charge Sales Tax?" preference), it will assign the default
              non-taxable code to all sales.

          sales_tax_item_id: The sales-tax item used to calculate the actual tax amount for this sales
              receipt's transactions by applying a specific tax rate collected for a single
              tax agency. Unlike `salesTaxCode`, which only indicates general taxability, this
              field drives the actual tax calculation and reporting.

              For sales receipts, while using this field to specify a single tax item/group
              that applies uniformly is recommended, complex tax scenarios may require
              alternative approaches. In such cases, you can set this field to a 0% tax item
              (conventionally named "Tax Calculated On Invoice") and handle tax calculations
              through line items instead. When using line items for taxes, note that only
              individual tax items (not tax groups) can be used, subtotals can help apply a
              tax to multiple items but only the first tax line after a subtotal is calculated
              automatically (subsequent tax lines require manual amounts), and the rate column
              will always display the actual tax amount rather than the rate percentage.

          shipment_origin: The origin location from where the product associated with this sales receipt is
              shipped. This is the point at which ownership and liability for goods transfer
              from seller to buyer. Internally, QuickBooks uses the term "FOB" for this field,
              which stands for "freight on board". This field is informational and has no
              accounting implications.

          shipping_address: The sales receipt's shipping address.

          shipping_date: The date when the products or services for this sales receipt were shipped or
              are expected to be shipped, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          shipping_method_id: The shipping method used for this sales receipt, such as standard mail or
              overnight delivery.

        """Returns a list of sales receipts.

        Use the `cursor` parameter to paginate through
        the results.

        Args:
          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          account_ids: Filter for sales receipts associated with these accounts.

          currency_ids: Filter for sales receipts in these currencies.

          cursor: The pagination token to fetch the next set of results when paginating with the
              `limit` parameter. Retrieve this value from the `nextCursor` field in the
              previous response. If omitted, the API returns the first page of results.

          customer_ids: Filter for sales receipts created for these customers.

          ids: Filter for specific sales receipts by their QuickBooks-assigned unique
              identifier(s).

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          include_line_items: Whether to include line items in the response. Defaults to `true`.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return. Accepts values ranging from 1 to 150,
              defaults to 150. When used with cursor-based pagination, this parameter controls
              how many results are returned per page. To paginate through results, combine
              this with the `cursor` parameter. Each response will include a `nextCursor`
              value that can be passed to subsequent requests to retrieve the next page of
              results.

          ref_number_contains: Filter for sales receipts whose `refNumber` contains this substring. NOTE: If
              you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberStartsWith` or
              `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_ends_with: Filter for sales receipts whose `refNumber` ends with this substring. NOTE: If
              you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberStartsWith`.

          ref_number_from: Filter for sales receipts whose `refNumber` is greater than or equal to this
              value. If omitted, the range will begin with the first number of the list. Uses
              a numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.

          ref_numbers: Filter for specific sales receipts by their ref-number(s), case-sensitive. In
              QuickBooks, ref-numbers are not required to be unique and can be arbitrarily
              changed by the QuickBooks user.

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          ref_number_starts_with: Filter for sales receipts whose `refNumber` starts with this substring. NOTE: If
              you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_to: Filter for sales receipts whose `refNumber` is less than or equal to this value.
              If omitted, the range will end with the last number of the list. Uses a
              numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.

          transaction_date_from: Filter for sales receipts created on or after this date, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD).

          transaction_date_to: Filter for sales receipts created on or before this date, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD).

          updated_after: Filter for sales receipts updated on or after this date and time, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time
              is assumed to be 00:00:00 of that day.

          updated_before: Filter for sales receipts updated on or before this date and time, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time
              is assumed to be 23:59:59 of that day.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request

          timeout: Override the client-level default timeout for this request, in seconds
