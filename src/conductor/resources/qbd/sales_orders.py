        Creates a new sales order.

        Args:
          customer_id: The customer or customer-job associated with this sales order.

          transaction_date: The date of this sales order, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          billing_address: The sales order's billing address.

          class_id: The sales order's class. Classes can be used to categorize objects into
              meaningful segments, such as department, location, or type of work. In
              QuickBooks, class tracking is off by default. A class defined here is
              automatically used in this sales order's line items unless overridden at the
              line item level.

          customer_message_id: The message to display to the customer on the sales order.

          document_template_id: The predefined template in QuickBooks that determines the layout and formatting
              for this sales order when printed or displayed.

          due_date: The date by which this sales order must be paid, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD).

          exchange_rate: The market exchange rate between this sales order's currency and the home
              currency in QuickBooks at the time of this transaction. Represented as a decimal
              value (e.g., 1.2345 for 1 EUR = 1.2345 USD if USD is the home currency).

          external_id: A globally unique identifier (GUID) you can provide for tracking this object in
              your external system.

              **IMPORTANT**: Must be formatted as a valid GUID; otherwise, QuickBooks will
              return an error. This field is immutable and can only be set during object
              creation.

          is_manually_closed: Indicates whether this sales order has been manually marked as closed, even if
              it has not been invoiced.

          is_queued_for_email: Indicates whether this sales order is included in the queue of documents for
              QuickBooks to email to the customer.

          is_queued_for_print: Indicates whether this sales order is included in the queue of documents for
              QuickBooks to print.

          line_groups: The sales order's line item groups, each representing a predefined set of
              related items.

              **IMPORTANT**: You must specify `lines`, `lineGroups`, or both when creating a
              sales order.

          lines: The sales order's line items, each representing a single product or service
              ordered.

              **IMPORTANT**: You must specify `lines`, `lineGroups`, or both when creating a
              sales order.

          memo: A memo or note for this sales order, as entered by the user.

          other_custom_field: A built-in custom field for additional information specific to this sales order.
              Unlike the user-defined fields in the `customFields` array, this is a standard
              QuickBooks field that exists for all sales orders for convenience. Developers
              often use this field for tracking information that doesn't fit into other
              standard QuickBooks fields. Unlike `otherCustomField1` and `otherCustomField2`,
              which are line item fields, this exists at the transaction level. Hidden by
              default in the QuickBooks UI.

          purchase_order_number: The customer's Purchase Order (PO) number associated with this sales order. This
              field is often used to cross-reference the sales order with the customer's
              purchasing system.

          ref_number: The case-sensitive user-defined reference number for this sales order, which can
              be used to identify the transaction in QuickBooks. This value is not required to
              be unique and can be arbitrarily changed by the QuickBooks user.

          sales_channel_name: The type of the sales channel for this sales order.

          sales_representative_id: The sales order's sales representative. Sales representatives can be employees,
              vendors, or other names in QuickBooks.

          sales_store_name: The name of the sales store for this sales order.

          sales_store_type: The type of the sales store for this sales order.

          sales_tax_code_id: The sales-tax code for items sold to the `customer` of this sales order,
              determining whether items sold to this customer are taxable or non-taxable.
              Default codes include "Non" (non-taxable) and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes
              can also be created in QuickBooks. If QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales
              tax (via the "Do You Charge Sales Tax?" preference), it will assign the default
              non-taxable code to all sales.

          sales_tax_item_id: The sales-tax item used to calculate the actual tax amount for this sales
              order's transactions by applying a specific tax rate collected for a single tax
              agency. Unlike `salesTaxCode`, which only indicates general taxability, this
              field drives the actual tax calculation and reporting.

          shipment_origin: The origin location from where the product associated with this sales order is
              shipped. This is the point at which ownership and liability for goods transfer
              from seller to buyer. Internally, QuickBooks uses the term "FOB" for this field,
              which stands for "freight on board". This field is informational and has no
              accounting implications.

          shipping_address: The sales order's shipping address.

          shipping_date: The date when the products or services for this sales order were shipped or are
              expected to be shipped, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          shipping_method_id: The shipping method used for this sales order, such as standard mail or
              overnight delivery.

          terms_id: The sales order's payment terms, defining when payment is due and any applicable
              discounts.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request

          timeout: Override the client-level default timeout for this request, in seconds

              QuickBooks field that exists for all sales orders for convenience. Developers
              often use this field for tracking information that doesn't fit into other
              standard QuickBooks fields. Unlike `otherCustomField1` and `otherCustomField2`,
              which are line item fields, this exists at the transaction level. Hidden by
              default in the QuickBooks UI.

          purchase_order_number: The customer's Purchase Order (PO) number associated with this sales order. This
              field is often used to cross-reference the sales order with the customer's
              purchasing system.

          ref_number: The case-sensitive user-defined reference number for this sales order, which can
              be used to identify the transaction in QuickBooks. This value is not required to
              be unique and can be arbitrarily changed by the QuickBooks user.

          sales_channel_name: The type of the sales channel for this sales order.

          sales_representative_id: The sales order's sales representative. Sales representatives can be employees,
              vendors, or other names in QuickBooks.

          sales_store_name: The name of the sales store for this sales order.

          sales_store_type: The type of the sales store for this sales order.

          sales_tax_code_id: The sales-tax code for items sold to the `customer` of this sales order,
              determining whether items sold to this customer are taxable or non-taxable.
              Default codes include "Non" (non-taxable) and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes
              can also be created in QuickBooks. If QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales
              tax (via the "Do You Charge Sales Tax?" preference), it will assign the default
              non-taxable code to all sales.

          sales_tax_item_id: The sales-tax item used to calculate the actual tax amount for this sales
              order's transactions by applying a specific tax rate collected for a single tax
              agency. Unlike `salesTaxCode`, which only indicates general taxability, this
              field drives the actual tax calculation and reporting.

          shipment_origin: The origin location from where the product associated with this sales order is
              shipped. This is the point at which ownership and liability for goods transfer
              from seller to buyer. Internally, QuickBooks uses the term "FOB" for this field,
              which stands for "freight on board". This field is informational and has no
              accounting implications.

          shipping_address: The sales order's shipping address.

          shipping_date: The date when the products or services for this sales order were shipped or are
              expected to be shipped, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          shipping_method_id: The shipping method used for this sales order, such as standard mail or
              overnight delivery.

          terms_id: The sales order's payment terms, defining when payment is due and any applicable
              discounts.

          transaction_date: The date of this sales order, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request

        Returns a list of sales orders.

        Args:
          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          currency_ids: Filter for sales orders in these currencies.

          cursor: The pagination token to fetch the next set of results when paginating with the
              `limit` parameter. Retrieve this value from the `nextCursor` field in the
              previous response. If omitted, the API returns the first page of results.

          customer_ids: Filter for sales orders for these customers.

          ids: Filter for specific sales orders by their QuickBooks-assigned unique
              identifier(s).

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          include_line_items: Whether to include line items in the response. Defaults to `true`.

          include_linked_transactions: Whether to include linked transactions in the response. Defaults to `false`. For
              example, a payment linked to the corresponding sales order.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return. Ranging from 1 to 150, defaults to 150.
              Use this parameter in conjunction with the `cursor` parameter to paginate
              through results. The response will include a `nextCursor` field, which can be
              used as the `cursor` parameter value in subsequent requests to fetch the next
              set of results.

          ref_number_contains: Filter for sales orders whose `refNumber` contains this substring. NOTE: If you
              use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberStartsWith` or
              `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_ends_with: Filter for sales orders whose `refNumber` ends with this substring. NOTE: If you
              use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberStartsWith`.

          ref_number_from: Filter for sales orders whose `refNumber` is greater than or equal to this
              value. If omitted, the range will begin with the first number of the list. Uses
              a numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.

          ref_numbers: Filter for specific sales orders by their ref-number(s), case-sensitive. In
              QuickBooks, ref-numbers are not required to be unique and can be arbitrarily
              changed by the QuickBooks user.

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          ref_number_starts_with: Filter for sales orders whose `refNumber` starts with this substring. NOTE: If
              you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_to: Filter for sales orders whose `refNumber` is less than or equal to this value.
              If omitted, the range will end with the last number of the list. Uses a
              numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.

          transaction_date_from: Filter for sales orders created on or after this date, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD).

          transaction_date_to: Filter for sales orders created on or before this date, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD).

          updated_after: Filter for sales orders updated on or after this date and time, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time
              is assumed to be 00:00:00 of that day.

          updated_before: Filter for sales orders updated on or before this date and time, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time

          memo: A memo or note for this sales order, as entered by the user.

          other_custom_field: A built-in custom field for additional information specific to this sales order.
              Unlike the user-defined fields in the `customFields` array, this is a standard
              QuickBooks field that exists for all sales orders for convenience. Developers
              often use this field for tracking information that doesn't fit into other
              standard QuickBooks fields. Unlike `otherCustomField1` and `otherCustomField2`,
              which are line item fields, this exists at the transaction level. Hidden by
              default in the QuickBooks UI.

          purchase_order_number: The customer's Purchase Order (PO) number associated with this sales order. This
              field is often used to cross-reference the sales order with the customer's
              purchasing system.

          ref_number: The case-sensitive user-defined reference number for this sales order, which can
              be used to identify the transaction in QuickBooks. This value is not required to
              be unique and can be arbitrarily changed by the QuickBooks user.

          sales_channel_name: The type of the sales channel for this sales order.

          sales_representative_id: The sales order's sales representative. Sales representatives can be employees,
              vendors, or other names in QuickBooks.

          sales_store_name: The name of the sales store for this sales order.

          sales_store_type: The type of the sales store for this sales order.

          sales_tax_code_id: The sales-tax code for items sold to the `customer` of this sales order,
              determining whether items sold to this customer are taxable or non-taxable.
              Default codes include "Non" (non-taxable) and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes
              can also be created in QuickBooks. If QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales
              tax (via the "Do You Charge Sales Tax?" preference), it will assign the default
              non-taxable code to all sales.

          sales_tax_item_id: The sales-tax item used to calculate the actual tax amount for this sales
              order's transactions by applying a specific tax rate collected for a single tax
              agency. Unlike `salesTaxCode`, which only indicates general taxability, this
              field drives the actual tax calculation and reporting.

          shipment_origin: The origin location from where the product associated with this sales order is
              shipped. This is the point at which ownership and liability for goods transfer
              from seller to buyer. Internally, QuickBooks uses the term "FOB" for this field,
              which stands for "freight on board". This field is informational and has no
              accounting implications.

          shipping_address: The sales order's shipping address.

          shipping_date: The date when the products or services for this sales order were shipped or are
              expected to be shipped, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          shipping_method_id: The shipping method used for this sales order, such as standard mail or
              overnight delivery.

          terms_id: The sales order's payment terms, defining when payment is due and any applicable
              discounts.

        Returns a list of sales orders.

        Args:
          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          currency_ids: Filter for sales orders in these currencies.

          cursor: The pagination token to fetch the next set of results when paginating with the
              `limit` parameter. Retrieve this value from the `nextCursor` field in the
              previous response. If omitted, the API returns the first page of results.

          customer_ids: Filter for sales orders for these customers.

          ids: Filter for specific sales orders by their QuickBooks-assigned unique
              identifier(s).

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          include_line_items: Whether to include line items in the response. Defaults to `true`.

          include_linked_transactions: Whether to include linked transactions in the response. Defaults to `false`. For
              example, a payment linked to the corresponding sales order.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return. Ranging from 1 to 150, defaults to 150.
              Use this parameter in conjunction with the `cursor` parameter to paginate
              through results. The response will include a `nextCursor` field, which can be
              used as the `cursor` parameter value in subsequent requests to fetch the next
              set of results.

          ref_number_contains: Filter for sales orders whose `refNumber` contains this substring. NOTE: If you
              use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberStartsWith` or
              `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_ends_with: Filter for sales orders whose `refNumber` ends with this substring. NOTE: If you
              use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberStartsWith`.

          ref_number_from: Filter for sales orders whose `refNumber` is greater than or equal to this
              value. If omitted, the range will begin with the first number of the list. Uses
              a numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.

          ref_numbers: Filter for specific sales orders by their ref-number(s), case-sensitive. In
              QuickBooks, ref-numbers are not required to be unique and can be arbitrarily
              changed by the QuickBooks user.

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          ref_number_starts_with: Filter for sales orders whose `refNumber` starts with this substring. NOTE: If
              you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_to: Filter for sales orders whose `refNumber` is less than or equal to this value.
              If omitted, the range will end with the last number of the list. Uses a
              numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.

          transaction_date_from: Filter for sales orders created on or after this date, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD).

          transaction_date_to: Filter for sales orders created on or before this date, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD).

          updated_after: Filter for sales orders updated on or after this date and time, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time
              is assumed to be 00:00:00 of that day.

          updated_before: Filter for sales orders updated on or before this date and time, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time
              is assumed to be 23:59:59 of that day.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request
