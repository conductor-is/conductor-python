        Creates a new bill check payment.

        Args:
          apply_to_transactions: The bills to be paid by this bill check payment. This will create a link between
              this bill check payment and the specified bills.

              **IMPORTANT**: In each `applyToTransactions` object, you must specify either
              `paymentAmount`, `applyCredits`, `discountAmount`, or any combination of these;
              if none of these are specified, you will receive an error for an empty
              transaction.

              **IMPORTANT**: The target bill must have `isPaid=false`, otherwise, QuickBooks
              will report this object as "cannot be found".

          bank_account_id: The bank account from which the funds are being drawn for this bill check
              payment; e.g., Checking or Savings. This bill check payment will decrease the
              balance of this account.

          transaction_date: The date of this bill check payment, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          vendor_id: The vendor who sent the bill(s) that this bill check payment is paying and who
              will receive this payment.

              **IMPORTANT**: This vendor must match the `vendor` on the bill(s) specified in
              `applyToTransactions`; otherwise, QuickBooks will say the `transactionId` in
              `applyToTransactions` "does not exist".

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          exchange_rate: The market exchange rate between this bill check payment's currency and the home
              currency in QuickBooks at the time of this transaction. Represented as a decimal
              value (e.g., 1.2345 for 1 EUR = 1.2345 USD if USD is the home currency).

          external_id: A globally unique identifier (GUID) you, the developer, can provide for tracking
              this object in your external system. This field is immutable and can only be set
              during object creation.

              **IMPORTANT**: This field must be formatted as a valid GUID; otherwise,
              QuickBooks will return an error.

          is_queued_for_print: Indicates whether this bill check payment is included in the queue of documents
              for QuickBooks to print.

          memo: A memo or note for this bill check payment.

          payables_account_id: The Accounts-Payable (A/P) account to which this bill check payment is assigned,
              used to track the amount owed. If not specified, QuickBooks Desktop will use its
              default A/P account.

              **IMPORTANT**: If this bill check payment is linked to other transactions, this
              A/P account must match the `payablesAccount` used in those other transactions.

          ref_number: The case-sensitive user-defined reference number for this bill check payment,
              which can be used to identify the transaction in QuickBooks. This value is not
              required to be unique and can be arbitrarily changed by the QuickBooks user.
              When left blank in this create request, this field will be left blank in
              QuickBooks (i.e., it does _not_ auto-increment).

              **IMPORTANT**: For checks, this field is the check number.

          account_ids: Filter for bill check payments associated with these accounts.

          currency_ids: Filter for bill check payments in these currencies.

          cursor: The pagination token to fetch the next set of results when paginating with the
              `limit` parameter. Do not include this parameter on the first call. Use the
              `nextCursor` value returned in the previous response to request subsequent
              results.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return. Accepts values ranging from 1 to 150,
              defaults to 150. When used with cursor-based pagination, this parameter controls
              how many results are returned per page. To paginate through results, combine
              this with the `cursor` parameter. Each response will include a `nextCursor`
              value that can be passed to subsequent requests to retrieve the next page of
              results.

          ref_number_contains: Filter for bill check payments whose `refNumber` contains this substring. (For
              checks, this field is the check number.) NOTE: If you use this parameter, you

          ref_number_from: Filter for bill check payments whose `refNumber` is greater than or equal to
              this value. (For checks, this field is the check number.) If omitted, the range
              will begin with the first number of the list. Uses a numerical comparison for
              values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a lexicographical comparison.

          ref_numbers: Filter for specific bill check payments by their ref-number(s), case-sensitive.
              In QuickBooks, ref-numbers are not required to be unique and can be arbitrarily
              changed by the QuickBooks user.

              query parameters for this request.

          ref_number_starts_with: Filter for bill check payments whose `refNumber` starts with this substring.
              (For checks, this field is the check number.) NOTE: If you use this parameter,
              you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_to: Filter for bill check payments whose `refNumber` is less than or equal to this
              value. (For checks, this field is the check number.) If omitted, the range will
              end with the last number of the list. Uses a numerical comparison for values
              that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a lexicographical comparison.

          transaction_date_from: Filter for bill check payments created on or after this date, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD).

          transaction_date_to: Filter for bill check payments created on or before this date, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          updated_after: Filter for bill check payments updated on or after this date and time, in ISO
              8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the

              this bill check payment and the specified bills.

              **IMPORTANT**: In each `applyToTransactions` object, you must specify either
              `paymentAmount`, `applyCredits`, `discountAmount`, or any combination of these;
              if none of these are specified, you will receive an error for an empty
              transaction.

              **IMPORTANT**: The target bill must have `isPaid=false`, otherwise, QuickBooks
              will report this object as "cannot be found".

          bank_account_id: The bank account from which the funds are being drawn for this bill check
              payment; e.g., Checking or Savings. This bill check payment will decrease the

          vendor_id: The vendor who sent the bill(s) that this bill check payment is paying and who
              will receive this payment.

              **IMPORTANT**: This vendor must match the `vendor` on the bill(s) specified in
              `applyToTransactions`; otherwise, QuickBooks will say the `transactionId` in
              `applyToTransactions` "does not exist".

              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          exchange_rate: The market exchange rate between this bill check payment's currency and the home
              currency in QuickBooks at the time of this transaction. Represented as a decimal
              value (e.g., 1.2345 for 1 EUR = 1.2345 USD if USD is the home currency).

          external_id: A globally unique identifier (GUID) you, the developer, can provide for tracking
              this object in your external system. This field is immutable and can only be set
              during object creation.

              **IMPORTANT**: This field must be formatted as a valid GUID; otherwise,
              QuickBooks will return an error.

          is_queued_for_print: Indicates whether this bill check payment is included in the queue of documents
              for QuickBooks to print.

          memo: A memo or note for this bill check payment.

          payables_account_id: The Accounts-Payable (A/P) account to which this bill check payment is assigned,
              used to track the amount owed. If not specified, QuickBooks Desktop will use its
              default A/P account.

              **IMPORTANT**: If this bill check payment is linked to other transactions, this
              A/P account must match the `payablesAccount` used in those other transactions.

          ref_number: The case-sensitive user-defined reference number for this bill check payment,
              which can be used to identify the transaction in QuickBooks. This value is not
              required to be unique and can be arbitrarily changed by the QuickBooks user.
              When left blank in this create request, this field will be left blank in
              QuickBooks (i.e., it does _not_ auto-increment).

              identifier(s).

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          include_line_items: Whether to include line items in the response. Defaults to `true`.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return. Accepts values ranging from 1 to 150,
              defaults to 150. When used with cursor-based pagination, this parameter controls
              how many results are returned per page. To paginate through results, combine
              this with the `cursor` parameter. Each response will include a `nextCursor`
              value that can be passed to subsequent requests to retrieve the next page of
              results.

          ref_number_contains: Filter for bill check payments whose `refNumber` contains this substring. (For
              checks, this field is the check number.) NOTE: If you use this parameter, you
              cannot also use `refNumberStartsWith` or `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_ends_with: Filter for bill check payments whose `refNumber` ends with this substring. (For
              checks, this field is the check number.) NOTE: If you use this parameter, you
              cannot also use `refNumberContains` or `refNumberStartsWith`.

          ref_number_from: Filter for bill check payments whose `refNumber` is greater than or equal to
              this value. (For checks, this field is the check number.) If omitted, the range
              will begin with the first number of the list. Uses a numerical comparison for
              values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a lexicographical comparison.

          ref_numbers: Filter for specific bill check payments by their ref-number(s), case-sensitive.
              In QuickBooks, ref-numbers are not required to be unique and can be arbitrarily
              changed by the QuickBooks user.

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          ref_number_starts_with: Filter for bill check payments whose `refNumber` starts with this substring.
              (For checks, this field is the check number.) NOTE: If you use this parameter,
              you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_to: Filter for bill check payments whose `refNumber` is less than or equal to this
              value. (For checks, this field is the check number.) If omitted, the range will
              end with the last number of the list. Uses a numerical comparison for values
              that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a lexicographical comparison.

          transaction_date_from: Filter for bill check payments created on or after this date, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD).

          transaction_date_to: Filter for bill check payments created on or before this date, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          updated_after: Filter for bill check payments updated on or after this date and time, in ISO
              8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the
              time is assumed to be 00:00:00 of that day.

          updated_before: Filter for bill check payments updated on or before this date and time, in ISO
              8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the
              time is assumed to be 23:59:59 of that day.

          vendor_ids: Filter for bill check payments sent to these vendors. These are the vendors who
              sent the bills paid by these checks.

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request
