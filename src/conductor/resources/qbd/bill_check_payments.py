        Creates a new bill check payment.

        Args:
          apply_to_transactions: The bills to be paid by this bill check payment. This will create a link between
              this bill check payment and the specified bills.

              **IMPORTANT**: In each `applyToTransactions` object, you must specify either
              `paymentAmount`, `applyCredits`, `discountAmount`, or any combination of these;
              if none of these are specified, you will receive an error for an empty
              transaction.

              **IMPORTANT**: The target bill must have `isPaid=false`, otherwise, QuickBooks
              will report this object as "cannot be found".

          bank_account_id: The bank account from which the funds are being drawn for this bill check
              payment; e.g., Checking or Savings. This bill check payment will decrease the
              balance of this account.

          transaction_date: The date of this bill check payment, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          vendor_id: The vendor who sent the bill(s) that this bill check payment is paying and who
              will receive this payment.

              **IMPORTANT**: This vendor must match the `vendor` on the bill(s) specified in
              `applyToTransactions`; otherwise, QuickBooks will say the `transactionId` in
              `applyToTransactions` "does not exist".

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          exchange_rate: The market exchange rate between this bill check payment's currency and the home
              currency in QuickBooks at the time of this transaction. Represented as a decimal
              value (e.g., 1.2345 for 1 EUR = 1.2345 USD if USD is the home currency).

          external_id: A globally unique identifier (GUID) you can provide for tracking this object in
              your external system.

              **IMPORTANT**: Must be formatted as a valid GUID; otherwise, QuickBooks will
              return an error. This field is immutable and can only be set during object
              creation.

          is_queued_for_print: Indicates whether this bill check payment is included in the queue of documents
              for QuickBooks to print.

          memo: A memo or note for this bill check payment.

          payables_account_id: The Accounts-Payable (A/P) account to which this bill check payment is assigned,
              used to track the amount owed. If not specified, QuickBooks Desktop will use its
              default A/P account.

              **IMPORTANT**: If this bill check payment is linked to other transactions, this
              A/P account must match the `payablesAccount` used in those other transactions.

          ref_number: The case-sensitive user-defined reference number for this bill check payment,
              which can be used to identify the transaction in QuickBooks. This value is not
              required to be unique and can be arbitrarily changed by the QuickBooks user.

              **IMPORTANT**: For checks, this field is the check number.

          ref_number_starts_with: Filter for bill check payments whose `refNumber` starts with this substring. For
              checks, this is the check number. NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot
              also use `refNumberContains` or `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_to: Filter for bill check payments whose `refNumber` is less than or equal to this
              value. If omitted, the range will end with the last number of the list. Uses a
              numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.

          transaction_date_from: Filter for bill check payments created on or after this date, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD).

          transaction_date_to: Filter for bill check payments created on or before this date, in ISO 8601

          updated_after: Filter for bill check payments updated on or after this date and time, in ISO
              8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the

          apply_to_transactions: The bills to be paid by this bill check payment. This will create a link between
              this bill check payment and the specified bills.

              **IMPORTANT**: In each `applyToTransactions` object, you must specify either
              `paymentAmount`, `applyCredits`, `discountAmount`, or any combination of these;
              if none of these are specified, you will receive an error for an empty
              transaction.

              **IMPORTANT**: The target bill must have `isPaid=false`, otherwise, QuickBooks
              will report this object as "cannot be found".

          bank_account_id: The bank account from which the funds are being drawn for this bill check
              payment; e.g., Checking or Savings. This bill check payment will decrease the
              balance of this account.

          transaction_date: The date of this bill check payment, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          vendor_id: The vendor who sent the bill(s) that this bill check payment is paying and who
              will receive this payment.

              **IMPORTANT**: This vendor must match the `vendor` on the bill(s) specified in
              `applyToTransactions`; otherwise, QuickBooks will say the `transactionId` in
              `applyToTransactions` "does not exist".

          exchange_rate: The market exchange rate between this bill check payment's currency and the home
              currency in QuickBooks at the time of this transaction. Represented as a decimal
              value (e.g., 1.2345 for 1 EUR = 1.2345 USD if USD is the home currency).

          external_id: A globally unique identifier (GUID) you can provide for tracking this object in
              your external system.

              **IMPORTANT**: Must be formatted as a valid GUID; otherwise, QuickBooks will
              return an error. This field is immutable and can only be set during object
              creation.

          is_queued_for_print: Indicates whether this bill check payment is included in the queue of documents
              for QuickBooks to print.

          memo: A memo or note for this bill check payment.

          payables_account_id: The Accounts-Payable (A/P) account to which this bill check payment is assigned,
              used to track the amount owed. If not specified, QuickBooks Desktop will use its
              default A/P account.

              **IMPORTANT**: If this bill check payment is linked to other transactions, this
              A/P account must match the `payablesAccount` used in those other transactions.

          ref_number: The case-sensitive user-defined reference number for this bill check payment,
              which can be used to identify the transaction in QuickBooks. This value is not
              required to be unique and can be arbitrarily changed by the QuickBooks user.

              Uses a numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses
              a lexicographical comparison.

          ref_numbers: Filter for specific bill check payments by their ref-number(s), case-sensitive.
              In QuickBooks, ref-numbers are not required to be unique and can be arbitrarily
              changed by the QuickBooks user.

              query parameters for this request.

          ref_number_starts_with: Filter for bill check payments whose `refNumber` starts with this substring. For
              checks, this is the check number. NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot
              also use `refNumberContains` or `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_to: Filter for bill check payments whose `refNumber` is less than or equal to this
              value. If omitted, the range will end with the last number of the list. Uses a
              numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.
