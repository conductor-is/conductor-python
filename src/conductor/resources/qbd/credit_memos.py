        Creates a new credit memo.

        Args:
          customer_id: The customer or customer-job associated with this credit memo.

          transaction_date: The date of this credit memo, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          billing_address: The credit memo's billing address.

          class_id: The credit memo's class. Classes can be used to categorize objects into
              meaningful segments, such as department, location, or type of work. In
              QuickBooks, class tracking is off by default. A class defined here is
              automatically used in this credit memo's line items unless overridden at the
              line item level.

          customer_message_id: The message to display to the customer on the credit memo.

          document_template_id: The predefined template in QuickBooks that determines the layout and formatting
              for this credit memo when printed or displayed.

          due_date: The date by which this credit memo must be paid, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD).

          exchange_rate: The market exchange rate between this credit memo's currency and the home
              currency in QuickBooks at the time of this transaction. Represented as a decimal
              value (e.g., 1.2345 for 1 EUR = 1.2345 USD if USD is the home currency).

          external_id: A globally unique identifier (GUID) you can provide for tracking this object in
              your external system.

              **IMPORTANT**: Must be formatted as a valid GUID; otherwise, QuickBooks will
              return an error. This field is immutable and can only be set during object
              creation.

          is_pending: Indicates whether this credit memo has not been completed.

          is_queued_for_email: Indicates whether this credit memo is included in the queue of documents for
              QuickBooks to email to the customer.

          is_queued_for_print: Indicates whether this credit memo is included in the queue of documents for
              QuickBooks to print.

          line_groups: The credit memo's line item groups, each representing a predefined set of
              related items.

              **IMPORTANT**: You must specify `lines`, `lineGroups`, or both when creating a
              credit memo.

          lines: The credit memo's line items, each representing a single product or service
              sold.

              **IMPORTANT**: You must specify `lines`, `lineGroups`, or both when creating a
              credit memo.

          memo: A memo or note for this credit memo that appears in the account register and
              customer register, but not on the credit memo itself.

          other_custom_field: A built-in custom field for additional information specific to this credit memo.
              Unlike the user-defined fields in the `customFields` array, this is a standard
              QuickBooks field that exists for all credit memos for convenience. Developers
              often use this field for tracking information that doesn't fit into other
              standard QuickBooks fields. Unlike `otherCustomField1` and `otherCustomField2`,
              which are line item fields, this exists at the transaction level. Hidden by
              default in the QuickBooks UI.

          purchase_order_number: The customer's Purchase Order (PO) number associated with this credit memo. This
              field is often used to cross-reference the credit memo with the customer's
              purchasing system.

          receivables_account_id: The Accounts-Receivable (A/R) account to which this credit memo is assigned,
              used to track the amount owed. If not specified, QuickBooks Desktop will use its
              default A/R account.

              **IMPORTANT**: If this credit memo is linked to other transactions, this A/R
              account must match the `receivablesAccount` used in all linked transactions. For
              example, when refunding a credit card payment, the A/R account must match the
              one used in the original credit transactions being refunded.

          ref_number: The case-sensitive user-defined reference number for this credit memo, which can
              be used to identify the transaction in QuickBooks. This value is not required to
              be unique and can be arbitrarily changed by the QuickBooks user.

          sales_representative_id: The credit memo's sales representative. Sales representatives can be employees,
              vendors, or other names in QuickBooks.

          sales_tax_code_id: The sales-tax code for this credit memo, determining whether it is taxable or
              non-taxable. This can be overridden at the transaction-line level.

              Default codes include "Non" (non-taxable) and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes
              can also be created in QuickBooks. If QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales
              tax (via the "Do You Charge Sales Tax?" preference), it will assign the default
              non-taxable code to all sales.

          sales_tax_item_id: The sales-tax item used to calculate the actual tax amount for this credit
              memo's transactions by applying a specific tax rate collected for a single tax
              agency. Unlike `salesTaxCode`, which only indicates general taxability, this
              field drives the actual tax calculation and reporting.

          shipment_origin: The origin location from where the product associated with this credit memo is
              shipped. This is the point at which ownership and liability for goods transfer
              from seller to buyer. Internally, QuickBooks uses the term "FOB" for this field,
              which stands for "freight on board". This field is informational and has no
              accounting implications.

          shipping_address: The credit memo's shipping address.

          shipping_date: The date when the products or services for this credit memo were shipped or are
              expected to be shipped, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          shipping_method_id: The shipping method used for this credit memo, such as standard mail or
              overnight delivery.

          terms_id: The credit memo's payment terms, defining when payment is due and any applicable
              discounts.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request

          timeout: Override the client-level default timeout for this request, in seconds

              standard QuickBooks fields. Unlike `otherCustomField1` and `otherCustomField2`,
              which are line item fields, this exists at the transaction level. Hidden by
              default in the QuickBooks UI.

          purchase_order_number: The customer's Purchase Order (PO) number associated with this credit memo. This
              field is often used to cross-reference the credit memo with the customer's
              purchasing system.

          receivables_account_id: The Accounts-Receivable (A/R) account to which this credit memo is assigned,
              used to track the amount owed. If not specified, QuickBooks Desktop will use its
              default A/R account.

              **IMPORTANT**: If this credit memo is linked to other transactions, this A/R
              account must match the `receivablesAccount` used in all linked transactions. For
              example, when refunding a credit card payment, the A/R account must match the
              one used in the original credit transactions being refunded.

          ref_number: The case-sensitive user-defined reference number for this credit memo, which can
              be used to identify the transaction in QuickBooks. This value is not required to
              be unique and can be arbitrarily changed by the QuickBooks user.

          sales_representative_id: The credit memo's sales representative. Sales representatives can be employees,
              vendors, or other names in QuickBooks.

          sales_tax_code_id: The sales-tax code for this credit memo, determining whether it is taxable or
              non-taxable. This can be overridden at the transaction-line level.

              Default codes include "Non" (non-taxable) and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes
              can also be created in QuickBooks. If QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales
              tax (via the "Do You Charge Sales Tax?" preference), it will assign the default
              non-taxable code to all sales.

          sales_tax_item_id: The sales-tax item used to calculate the actual tax amount for this credit
              memo's transactions by applying a specific tax rate collected for a single tax
              agency. Unlike `salesTaxCode`, which only indicates general taxability, this
              field drives the actual tax calculation and reporting.

          shipment_origin: The origin location from where the product associated with this credit memo is
              shipped. This is the point at which ownership and liability for goods transfer
              from seller to buyer. Internally, QuickBooks uses the term "FOB" for this field,
              which stands for "freight on board". This field is informational and has no
              accounting implications.

          shipping_address: The credit memo's shipping address.

          shipping_date: The date when the products or services for this credit memo were shipped or are
              expected to be shipped, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          shipping_method_id: The shipping method used for this credit memo, such as standard mail or
              overnight delivery.

          terms_id: The credit memo's payment terms, defining when payment is due and any applicable
              discounts.

          transaction_date: The date of this credit memo, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request

        Use the `cursor` parameter to paginate through
        the results.

        Args:
          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          account_ids: Filter for credit memos associated with these accounts.

          currency_ids: Filter for credit memos in these currencies.

          cursor: The pagination token to fetch the next set of results when paginating with the
              `limit` parameter. Retrieve this value from the `nextCursor` field in the
              previous response. If omitted, the API returns the first page of results.

          customer_ids: Filter for credit memos addressed to these customers.

          ids: Filter for specific credit memos by their QuickBooks-assigned unique
              identifier(s).

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          include_line_items: Whether to include line items in the response. Defaults to `true`.

          include_linked_transactions: Whether to include linked transactions in the response. Defaults to `false`. For
              example, a payment linked to the corresponding credit memo.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return. Accepts values ranging from 1 to 150,
              defaults to 150. When used with cursor-based pagination, this parameter controls
              how many results are returned per page. To paginate through results, combine
              this with the `cursor` parameter. Each response will include a `nextCursor`
              value that can be passed to subsequent requests to retrieve the next page of
              results.

          ref_number_contains: Filter for credit memos whose `refNumber` contains this substring. NOTE: If you
              use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberStartsWith` or
              `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_ends_with: Filter for credit memos whose `refNumber` ends with this substring. NOTE: If you
              use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberStartsWith`.

          ref_number_from: Filter for credit memos whose `refNumber` is greater than or equal to this
              value. If omitted, the range will begin with the first number of the list. Uses
              a numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.

          ref_numbers: Filter for specific credit memos by their ref-number(s), case-sensitive. In
              QuickBooks, ref-numbers are not required to be unique and can be arbitrarily
              changed by the QuickBooks user.

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          ref_number_starts_with: Filter for credit memos whose `refNumber` starts with this substring. NOTE: If
              you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_to: Filter for credit memos whose `refNumber` is less than or equal to this value.
              If omitted, the range will end with the last number of the list. Uses a
              numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.

          transaction_date_from: Filter for credit memos created on or after this date, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD).

          transaction_date_to: Filter for credit memos created on or before this date, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD).

          updated_after: Filter for credit memos updated on or after this date and time, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time
              is assumed to be 00:00:00 of that day.

          updated_before: Filter for credit memos updated on or before this date and time, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time

          memo: A memo or note for this credit memo that appears in the account register and
              customer register, but not on the credit memo itself.

          other_custom_field: A built-in custom field for additional information specific to this credit memo.
              Unlike the user-defined fields in the `customFields` array, this is a standard
              QuickBooks field that exists for all credit memos for convenience. Developers
              often use this field for tracking information that doesn't fit into other
              standard QuickBooks fields. Unlike `otherCustomField1` and `otherCustomField2`,
              which are line item fields, this exists at the transaction level. Hidden by
              default in the QuickBooks UI.

          purchase_order_number: The customer's Purchase Order (PO) number associated with this credit memo. This
              field is often used to cross-reference the credit memo with the customer's
              purchasing system.

          receivables_account_id: The Accounts-Receivable (A/R) account to which this credit memo is assigned,
              used to track the amount owed. If not specified, QuickBooks Desktop will use its
              default A/R account.

              **IMPORTANT**: If this credit memo is linked to other transactions, this A/R
              account must match the `receivablesAccount` used in all linked transactions. For
              example, when refunding a credit card payment, the A/R account must match the
              one used in the original credit transactions being refunded.

          ref_number: The case-sensitive user-defined reference number for this credit memo, which can
              be used to identify the transaction in QuickBooks. This value is not required to
              be unique and can be arbitrarily changed by the QuickBooks user.

          sales_representative_id: The credit memo's sales representative. Sales representatives can be employees,
              vendors, or other names in QuickBooks.

          sales_tax_code_id: The sales-tax code for this credit memo, determining whether it is taxable or
              non-taxable. This can be overridden at the transaction-line level.

              Default codes include "Non" (non-taxable) and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes
              can also be created in QuickBooks. If QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales
              tax (via the "Do You Charge Sales Tax?" preference), it will assign the default
              non-taxable code to all sales.

          sales_tax_item_id: The sales-tax item used to calculate the actual tax amount for this credit
              memo's transactions by applying a specific tax rate collected for a single tax
              agency. Unlike `salesTaxCode`, which only indicates general taxability, this
              field drives the actual tax calculation and reporting.

          shipment_origin: The origin location from where the product associated with this credit memo is
              shipped. This is the point at which ownership and liability for goods transfer
              from seller to buyer. Internally, QuickBooks uses the term "FOB" for this field,
              which stands for "freight on board". This field is informational and has no
              accounting implications.

          shipping_address: The credit memo's shipping address.

          shipping_date: The date when the products or services for this credit memo were shipped or are
              expected to be shipped, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          shipping_method_id: The shipping method used for this credit memo, such as standard mail or
              overnight delivery.

          terms_id: The credit memo's payment terms, defining when payment is due and any applicable
              discounts.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

        """Returns a list of credit memos.

        Use the `cursor` parameter to paginate through
        the results.

        Args:
          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          account_ids: Filter for credit memos associated with these accounts.

          currency_ids: Filter for credit memos in these currencies.

          cursor: The pagination token to fetch the next set of results when paginating with the
              `limit` parameter. Retrieve this value from the `nextCursor` field in the
              previous response. If omitted, the API returns the first page of results.

          customer_ids: Filter for credit memos addressed to these customers.

          ids: Filter for specific credit memos by their QuickBooks-assigned unique
              identifier(s).

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          include_line_items: Whether to include line items in the response. Defaults to `true`.

          include_linked_transactions: Whether to include linked transactions in the response. Defaults to `false`. For
              example, a payment linked to the corresponding credit memo.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return. Accepts values ranging from 1 to 150,
              defaults to 150. When used with cursor-based pagination, this parameter controls
              how many results are returned per page. To paginate through results, combine
              this with the `cursor` parameter. Each response will include a `nextCursor`
              value that can be passed to subsequent requests to retrieve the next page of
              results.

          ref_number_contains: Filter for credit memos whose `refNumber` contains this substring. NOTE: If you
              use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberStartsWith` or
              `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_ends_with: Filter for credit memos whose `refNumber` ends with this substring. NOTE: If you
              use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberStartsWith`.

          ref_number_from: Filter for credit memos whose `refNumber` is greater than or equal to this
              value. If omitted, the range will begin with the first number of the list. Uses
              a numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.

          ref_numbers: Filter for specific credit memos by their ref-number(s), case-sensitive. In
              QuickBooks, ref-numbers are not required to be unique and can be arbitrarily
              changed by the QuickBooks user.

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          ref_number_starts_with: Filter for credit memos whose `refNumber` starts with this substring. NOTE: If
              you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_to: Filter for credit memos whose `refNumber` is less than or equal to this value.
              If omitted, the range will end with the last number of the list. Uses a
              numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.

          transaction_date_from: Filter for credit memos created on or after this date, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD).

          transaction_date_to: Filter for credit memos created on or before this date, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD).

          updated_after: Filter for credit memos updated on or after this date and time, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time
              is assumed to be 00:00:00 of that day.

          updated_before: Filter for credit memos updated on or before this date and time, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time
              is assumed to be 23:59:59 of that day.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request

          timeout: Override the client-level default timeout for this request, in seconds
