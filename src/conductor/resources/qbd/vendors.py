        Creates a new vendor.

        Args:
          name: The case-insensitive unique name of this vendor, unique across all vendors.

              **NOTE**: Vendors do not have a `fullName` field because they are not
              hierarchical objects, which is why `name` is unique for them but not for objects
              that have parents. Maximum length: 41 characters.

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          account_number: The vendor's account number, which appears in the QuickBooks chart of accounts,
              reports, and graphs. Note that if the "Use Account Numbers" preference is turned
              off in QuickBooks, the account number may not be visible in the user interface,
              but it can still be set and retrieved through the API.

          additional_contacts: Additional alternate contacts for this vendor.

          additional_notes: Additional notes about this vendor.

          alternate_contact: The name of a alternate contact person for this vendor.

          cc_email: An email address to carbon copy (CC) on communications with this vendor.

          class_id: The vendor's class. Classes can be used to categorize objects into meaningful
              segments, such as department, location, or type of work. In QuickBooks, class
              tracking is off by default.

          company_name: The name of the company associated with this vendor. This name is used on
              invoices, checks, and other forms.

          contact: The name of the primary contact person for this vendor.

          credit_limit: The vendor's credit limit, represented as a decimal string. This is the maximum

              there is no credit limit.

          currency_id: The vendor's currency. For built-in currencies, the name and code are standard
              international values. For user-defined currencies, all values are editable.

          email: The vendor's email address.

          external_id: A globally unique identifier (GUID) you can provide for tracking this object in
              your external system.

              **IMPORTANT**: Must be formatted as a valid GUID; otherwise, QuickBooks will
              return an error. This field is immutable and can only be set during object
              creation.

          fax: The vendor's fax number.

          first_name: The first name of the contact person for this vendor.

          is_active: Indicates whether this vendor is active. Inactive objects are typically hidden
              from views and reports in QuickBooks.

          is_compounding_tax: Indicates whether tax is charged on top of tax for this vendor, for use in
              Canada or the UK.

          is_eligible_for1099: Indicates whether this vendor is eligible to receive a 1099 form for tax
              reporting purposes. If `true`, then the fields `taxId` and `billingAddress` are

          middle_name: The middle name of the contact person for this vendor.

          name_on_check: The vendor's name as it should appear on checks issued to this vendor.

          note: Additional notes or comments about this vendor.

          opening_balance: The opening balance of this vendor's account, indicating the amount owed to this

          sales_tax_code_id: The sales-tax code associated with this vendor, determining whether items bought
              from this vendor are taxable or non-taxable. It's used to assign a default tax
              status to all transactions for this vendor. Default codes include "Non"
              (non-taxable) and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes can also be created in
              QuickBooks. If QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales tax (via the "Do You
              Charge Sales Tax?" preference), it will assign the default non-taxable code to
              all sales.

          sales_tax_country: The country for which sales tax is collected for this vendor.

          sales_tax_return_id: The vendor's sales tax return information, used for tracking and reporting sales
              tax liabilities.

              as industry or region.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request

          timeout: Override the client-level default timeout for this request, in seconds

          revision_number: The current revision number of the vendor object you are updating, which you can
              get by fetching the object first. Provide the most recent `revisionNumber` to
              ensure you're working with the latest data; otherwise, the update will return an
              error.

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,

              tracking is off by default.

          company_name: The name of the company associated with this vendor. This name is used on
              invoices, checks, and other forms.

          contact: The name of the primary contact person for this vendor.

          name: The case-insensitive unique name of this vendor, unique across all vendors.

              **NOTE**: Vendors do not have a `fullName` field because they are not
              hierarchical objects, which is why `name` is unique for them but not for objects
              that have parents. Maximum length: 41 characters.

          name_on_check: The vendor's name as it should appear on checks issued to this vendor.

          sales_tax_code_id: The sales-tax code associated with this vendor, determining whether items bought
              from this vendor are taxable or non-taxable. It's used to assign a default tax

              (non-taxable) and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes can also be created in
              QuickBooks. If QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales tax (via the "Do You
              Charge Sales Tax?" preference), it will assign the default non-taxable code to
              all sales.

          sales_tax_country: The country for which sales tax is collected for this vendor.

          sales_tax_return_id: The vendor's sales tax return information, used for tracking and reporting sales

        Returns a list of vendors.

        Args:
          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          class_ids: Filter for vendors of these classes. A class is a way end-users can categorize
              vendors in QuickBooks.

          currency_ids: Filter for vendors in these currencies.

          cursor: The pagination token to fetch the next set of results when paginating with the
              `limit` parameter. Retrieve this value from the `nextCursor` field in the
              previous response. If omitted, the API returns the first page of results.

          ids: Filter for specific vendors by their QuickBooks-assigned unique identifier(s).

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return. Ranging from 1 to 150, defaults to 150.
              Use this parameter in conjunction with the `cursor` parameter to paginate
              through results. The response will include a `nextCursor` field, which can be
              used as the `cursor` parameter value in subsequent requests to fetch the next
              set of results.

          name_contains:
              Filter for vendors whose `name` contains this substring, case-insensitive. NOTE:
              If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameStartsWith` or
              `nameEndsWith`.

          name_ends_with: Filter for vendors whose `name` ends with this substring, case-insensitive.
              NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameContains` or
              `nameStartsWith`.

          name_from: Filter for vendors whose `name` is alphabetically greater than or equal to this
              value.

          names: Filter for specific vendors by their name(s), case-insensitive. Like `id`,
              `name` is a unique identifier for a vendor.

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          name_starts_with: Filter for vendors whose `name` starts with this substring, case-insensitive.
              NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameContains` or
              `nameEndsWith`.

          name_to: Filter for vendors whose `name` is alphabetically less than or equal to this
              value.

          status: Filter for vendors that are active, inactive, or both.

          total_balance: Filter for vendors whose `totalBalance` equals this amount, represented as a
              decimal string. You can only use one total-balance filter at a time.

          total_balance_greater_than: Filter for vendors whose `totalBalance` is greater than this amount, represented
              as a decimal string. You can only use one total-balance filter at a time.

          total_balance_greater_than_or_equal_to: Filter for vendors whose `totalBalance` is greater than or equal to this amount,
              represented as a decimal string. You can only use one total-balance filter at a
              time.

          total_balance_less_than: Filter for vendors whose `totalBalance` is less than this amount, represented as
              a decimal string. You can only use one total-balance filter at a time.

          total_balance_less_than_or_equal_to: Filter for vendors whose `totalBalance` is less than or equal to this amount,
              represented as a decimal string. You can only use one total-balance filter at a
              time.

          updated_after: Filter for vendors updated on or after this date and time, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time is
              assumed to be 00:00:00 of that day.

          updated_before: Filter for vendors updated on or before this date and time, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time is

        Args:
          name: The case-insensitive unique name of this vendor, unique across all vendors.

              **NOTE**: Vendors do not have a `fullName` field because they are not
              hierarchical objects, which is why `name` is unique for them but not for objects
              that have parents. Maximum length: 41 characters.

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,

              your external system.

              **IMPORTANT**: Must be formatted as a valid GUID; otherwise, QuickBooks will
              return an error. This field is immutable and can only be set during object
              creation.

              from this vendor are taxable or non-taxable. It's used to assign a default tax
              status to all transactions for this vendor. Default codes include "Non"
              (non-taxable) and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes can also be created in
              QuickBooks. If QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales tax (via the "Do You
              Charge Sales Tax?" preference), it will assign the default non-taxable code to
              all sales.

          sales_tax_country: The country for which sales tax is collected for this vendor.

              **NOTE**: Vendors do not have a `fullName` field because they are not
              hierarchical objects, which is why `name` is unique for them but not for objects
              that have parents. Maximum length: 41 characters.

          name_on_check: The vendor's name as it should appear on checks issued to this vendor.

          sales_tax_code_id: The sales-tax code associated with this vendor, determining whether items bought
              from this vendor are taxable or non-taxable. It's used to assign a default tax
              status to all transactions for this vendor. Default codes include "Non"
              (non-taxable) and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes can also be created in
              QuickBooks. If QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales tax (via the "Do You
              Charge Sales Tax?" preference), it will assign the default non-taxable code to
              all sales.

          sales_tax_country: The country for which sales tax is collected for this vendor.

          sales_tax_return_id: The vendor's sales tax return information, used for tracking and reporting sales
              tax liabilities.

        Returns a list of vendors.

        Args:
          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          class_ids: Filter for vendors of these classes. A class is a way end-users can categorize
              vendors in QuickBooks.

          currency_ids: Filter for vendors in these currencies.

          cursor: The pagination token to fetch the next set of results when paginating with the
              `limit` parameter. Retrieve this value from the `nextCursor` field in the
              previous response. If omitted, the API returns the first page of results.

          ids: Filter for specific vendors by their QuickBooks-assigned unique identifier(s).

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return. Ranging from 1 to 150, defaults to 150.
              Use this parameter in conjunction with the `cursor` parameter to paginate
              through results. The response will include a `nextCursor` field, which can be
              used as the `cursor` parameter value in subsequent requests to fetch the next
              set of results.

          name_contains:
              Filter for vendors whose `name` contains this substring, case-insensitive. NOTE:
              If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameStartsWith` or
              `nameEndsWith`.

          name_ends_with: Filter for vendors whose `name` ends with this substring, case-insensitive.
              NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameContains` or
              `nameStartsWith`.

          name_from: Filter for vendors whose `name` is alphabetically greater than or equal to this
              value.

          names: Filter for specific vendors by their name(s), case-insensitive. Like `id`,
              `name` is a unique identifier for a vendor.

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          name_starts_with: Filter for vendors whose `name` starts with this substring, case-insensitive.
              NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameContains` or
              `nameEndsWith`.

          name_to: Filter for vendors whose `name` is alphabetically less than or equal to this
              value.

          status: Filter for vendors that are active, inactive, or both.

          total_balance: Filter for vendors whose `totalBalance` equals this amount, represented as a
              decimal string. You can only use one total-balance filter at a time.

          total_balance_greater_than: Filter for vendors whose `totalBalance` is greater than this amount, represented
              as a decimal string. You can only use one total-balance filter at a time.

          total_balance_greater_than_or_equal_to: Filter for vendors whose `totalBalance` is greater than or equal to this amount,
              represented as a decimal string. You can only use one total-balance filter at a
              time.

          total_balance_less_than: Filter for vendors whose `totalBalance` is less than this amount, represented as
              a decimal string. You can only use one total-balance filter at a time.

          total_balance_less_than_or_equal_to: Filter for vendors whose `totalBalance` is less than or equal to this amount,
              represented as a decimal string. You can only use one total-balance filter at a
              time.

          updated_after: Filter for vendors updated on or after this date and time, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time is
              assumed to be 00:00:00 of that day.

          updated_before: Filter for vendors updated on or before this date and time, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time is
              assumed to be 23:59:59 of that day.
