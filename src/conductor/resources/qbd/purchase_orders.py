        Creates a new purchase order.

        Args:
          transaction_date: The date of this purchase order, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          vendor_id: The vendor who sent this purchase order for goods or services purchased.

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          class_id: The purchase order's class. Classes can be used to categorize objects into
              meaningful segments, such as department, location, or type of work. In
              QuickBooks, class tracking is off by default. A class defined here is
              automatically used in this purchase order's line items unless overridden at the
              line item level.

          document_template_id: The predefined template in QuickBooks that determines the layout and formatting
              for this purchase order when printed or displayed.

          due_date: The date by which this purchase order must be paid, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD).

          exchange_rate: The market exchange rate between this purchase order's currency and the home
              currency in QuickBooks at the time of this transaction. Represented as a decimal
              value (e.g., 1.2345 for 1 EUR = 1.2345 USD if USD is the home currency).

          expected_date: The date on which shipment of this purchase order is expected to be completed,
              in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          external_id: A globally unique identifier (GUID) you can provide for tracking this object in
              your external system.

              **IMPORTANT**: Must be formatted as a valid GUID; otherwise, QuickBooks will
              return an error. This field is immutable and can only be set during object
              creation.

          inventory_site_id: The site location where inventory for the item associated with this purchase
              order is stored.

          is_queued_for_email: Indicates whether this purchase order is included in the queue of documents for
              QuickBooks to email to the customer.

          is_queued_for_print: Indicates whether this purchase order is included in the queue of documents for
              QuickBooks to print.

          line_groups: The purchase order's line item groups, each representing a predefined set of
              related items.

              **IMPORTANT**: You must specify `lines`, `lineGroups`, or both when creating a
              purchase order.

          lines: The purchase order's line items, each representing a single product or service
              ordered.

              **IMPORTANT**: You must specify `lines`, `lineGroups`, or both when creating a
              purchase order.

          memo: A memo or note for this purchase order that appears in reports, but not on the
              purchase order.

          other_custom_field1: A built-in custom field for additional information specific to this purchase
              order. Unlike the user-defined fields in the `customFields` array, this is a
              standard QuickBooks field that exists for all purchase orders for convenience.
              Developers often use this field for tracking information that doesn't fit into
              other standard QuickBooks fields. Hidden by default in the QuickBooks UI.

          other_custom_field2: A second built-in custom field for additional information specific to this
              purchase order. Unlike the user-defined fields in the `customFields` array, this
              is a standard QuickBooks field that exists for all purchase orders for
              convenience. Like `otherCustomField1`, developers often use this field for
              tracking information that doesn't fit into other standard QuickBooks fields.
              Hidden by default in the QuickBooks UI.

          ref_number: The case-sensitive user-defined reference number for this purchase order, which
              can be used to identify the transaction in QuickBooks. This value is not
              required to be unique and can be arbitrarily changed by the QuickBooks user.

          sales_tax_code_id: The sales-tax code associated with this purchase order, determining whether
              items bought from this vendor are taxable or non-taxable. It's used to assign a
              default tax status to all transactions for this purchase order. Default codes
              include "Non" (non-taxable) and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes can also be
              created in QuickBooks. If QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales tax (via the
              "Do You Charge Sales Tax?" preference), it will assign the default non-taxable
              code to all sales.

          shipment_origin: The origin location from where the product associated with this purchase order
              is shipped. This is the point at which ownership and liability for goods
              transfer from seller to buyer. Internally, QuickBooks uses the term "FOB" for
              this field, which stands for "freight on board". This field is informational and
              has no accounting implications.

          shipping_address: The purchase order's shipping address.

          shipping_method_id: The shipping method used for this purchase order, such as standard mail or
              overnight delivery.

          ship_to_entity_id: The customer, vendor, employee, or other entity to whom this purchase order is
              to be shipped.

          terms_id: The purchase order's payment terms, defining when payment is due and any
              applicable discounts.

          vendor_address: The address of the vendor who sent this purchase order.

          vendor_message: A message to be printed on this purchase order for the vendor to read.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request

          timeout: Override the client-level default timeout for this request, in seconds

          sales_tax_code_id: The sales-tax code associated with this purchase order, determining whether
              items bought from this vendor are taxable or non-taxable. It's used to assign a
              default tax status to all transactions for this purchase order. Default codes
              include "Non" (non-taxable) and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes can also be
              created in QuickBooks. If QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales tax (via the
              "Do You Charge Sales Tax?" preference), it will assign the default non-taxable
              code to all sales.

          shipment_origin: The origin location from where the product associated with this purchase order
              is shipped. This is the point at which ownership and liability for goods
              transfer from seller to buyer. Internally, QuickBooks uses the term "FOB" for
              this field, which stands for "freight on board". This field is informational and
              has no accounting implications.

          shipping_address: The purchase order's shipping address.

          shipping_method_id: The shipping method used for this purchase order, such as standard mail or
              overnight delivery.

          ship_to_entity_id: The customer, vendor, employee, or other entity to whom this purchase order is
              to be shipped.

          terms_id: The purchase order's payment terms, defining when payment is due and any
              applicable discounts.

          transaction_date: The date of this purchase order, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          vendor_address: The address of the vendor who sent this purchase order.

          vendor_id: The vendor who sent this purchase order for goods or services purchased.

          vendor_message: A message to be printed on this purchase order for the vendor to read.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request

        Returns a list of purchase orders.

        Args:
          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          account_ids: Filter for purchase orders associated with these accounts.

          currency_ids: Filter for purchase orders in these currencies.

          cursor: The pagination token to fetch the next set of results when paginating with the
              `limit` parameter. Retrieve this value from the `nextCursor` field in the
              previous response. If omitted, the API returns the first page of results.

          ids: Filter for specific purchase orders by their QuickBooks-assigned unique
              identifier(s).

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          include_line_items: Whether to include line items in the response. Defaults to `true`.

          include_linked_transactions: Whether to include linked transactions in the response. Defaults to `false`. For
              example, a payment linked to the corresponding purchase order.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return. Ranging from 1 to 150, defaults to 150.
              Use this parameter in conjunction with the `cursor` parameter to paginate
              through results. The response will include a `nextCursor` field, which can be
              used as the `cursor` parameter value in subsequent requests to fetch the next
              set of results.

          ref_number_contains: Filter for purchase orders whose `refNumber` contains this substring. NOTE: If
              you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberStartsWith` or
              `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_ends_with: Filter for purchase orders whose `refNumber` ends with this substring. NOTE: If
              you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberStartsWith`.

          ref_number_from: Filter for purchase orders whose `refNumber` is greater than or equal to this
              value. If omitted, the range will begin with the first number of the list. Uses
              a numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.

          ref_numbers: Filter for specific purchase orders by their ref-number(s), case-sensitive. In
              QuickBooks, ref-numbers are not required to be unique and can be arbitrarily
              changed by the QuickBooks user.

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

              Filter for purchase orders whose `refNumber` starts with this substring. NOTE:
              If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_to: Filter for purchase orders whose `refNumber` is less than or equal to this
              value. If omitted, the range will end with the last number of the list. Uses a
              numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.

          transaction_date_from: Filter for purchase orders created on or after this date, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD).

          transaction_date_to: Filter for purchase orders created on or before this date, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD).

          updated_after: Filter for purchase orders updated on or after this date and time, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time
              is assumed to be 00:00:00 of that day.

          updated_before: Filter for purchase orders updated on or before this date and time, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time
              is assumed to be 23:59:59 of that day.

          transaction_date: The date of this purchase order, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          vendor_id: The vendor who sent this purchase order for goods or services purchased.

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          class_id: The purchase order's class. Classes can be used to categorize objects into
              meaningful segments, such as department, location, or type of work. In
              QuickBooks, class tracking is off by default. A class defined here is
              automatically used in this purchase order's line items unless overridden at the
              line item level.

          document_template_id: The predefined template in QuickBooks that determines the layout and formatting
              for this purchase order when printed or displayed.

          due_date: The date by which this purchase order must be paid, in ISO 8601 format

              in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          external_id: A globally unique identifier (GUID) you can provide for tracking this object in
              your external system.

              **IMPORTANT**: Must be formatted as a valid GUID; otherwise, QuickBooks will
              return an error. This field is immutable and can only be set during object
              creation.

          inventory_site_id: The site location where inventory for the item associated with this purchase
              order is stored.

          is_queued_for_email: Indicates whether this purchase order is included in the queue of documents for
              QuickBooks to email to the customer.

          is_queued_for_print: Indicates whether this purchase order is included in the queue of documents for
              QuickBooks to print.

          line_groups: The purchase order's line item groups, each representing a predefined set of
              related items.

              **IMPORTANT**: You must specify `lines`, `lineGroups`, or both when creating a
              purchase order.

          lines: The purchase order's line items, each representing a single product or service
              ordered.

              **IMPORTANT**: You must specify `lines`, `lineGroups`, or both when creating a
              purchase order.

          memo: A memo or note for this purchase order that appears in reports, but not on the
              purchase order.

          other_custom_field1: A built-in custom field for additional information specific to this purchase
              order. Unlike the user-defined fields in the `customFields` array, this is a
              standard QuickBooks field that exists for all purchase orders for convenience.
              Developers often use this field for tracking information that doesn't fit into
              other standard QuickBooks fields. Hidden by default in the QuickBooks UI.

          other_custom_field2: A second built-in custom field for additional information specific to this
              purchase order. Unlike the user-defined fields in the `customFields` array, this
              is a standard QuickBooks field that exists for all purchase orders for
              convenience. Like `otherCustomField1`, developers often use this field for
              tracking information that doesn't fit into other standard QuickBooks fields.
              Hidden by default in the QuickBooks UI.

          ref_number: The case-sensitive user-defined reference number for this purchase order, which
              can be used to identify the transaction in QuickBooks. This value is not
              required to be unique and can be arbitrarily changed by the QuickBooks user.

          sales_tax_code_id: The sales-tax code associated with this purchase order, determining whether
              items bought from this vendor are taxable or non-taxable. It's used to assign a
              default tax status to all transactions for this purchase order. Default codes
              include "Non" (non-taxable) and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes can also be
              created in QuickBooks. If QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales tax (via the

        Args:
          id: The QuickBooks-assigned unique identifier of the purchase order to update.

          revision_number: The current revision number of the purchase order object you are updating, which
              you can get by fetching the object first. Provide the most recent
              `revisionNumber` to ensure you're working with the latest data; otherwise, the

              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          class_id: The purchase order's class. Classes can be used to categorize objects into
              meaningful segments, such as department, location, or type of work. In
              QuickBooks, class tracking is off by default. A class defined here is
              automatically used in this purchase order's line items unless overridden at the
              line item level.

          document_template_id: The predefined template in QuickBooks that determines the layout and formatting
              for this purchase order when printed or displayed.

          due_date: The date by which this purchase order must be paid, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD).

          exchange_rate: The market exchange rate between this purchase order's currency and the home
              currency in QuickBooks at the time of this transaction. Represented as a decimal
              value (e.g., 1.2345 for 1 EUR = 1.2345 USD if USD is the home currency).

          expected_date: The date on which shipment of this purchase order is expected to be completed,
              in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          inventory_site_id: The site location where inventory for the item associated with this purchase
              order is stored.

          is_manually_closed: Indicates whether this purchase order has been manually marked as closed, even
              if all items have not been received or the sale has not been cancelled. Once the
              purchase order is marked as closed, all of its line items become closed as well.
              You cannot change `isManuallyClosed` to `false` after the purchase order has
              been fully received.

          is_queued_for_email: Indicates whether this purchase order is included in the queue of documents for
              QuickBooks to email to the customer.

          is_queued_for_print: Indicates whether this purchase order is included in the queue of documents for
              QuickBooks to print.

          line_groups: The purchase order's line item groups, each representing a predefined set of
              related items.

              **IMPORTANT**: When updating a purchase order's line item groups, this array
              completely REPLACES all existing line item groups for that purchase order. To
              retain any current line item groups, include them in this array, even if they
              have not changed. Any line item groups not included will be removed. To add a
              new line item group, include it with its `id` set to `-1`. If you do not wish to
              modify the line item groups, you can omit this field entirely to keep them
              unchanged.

          lines: The purchase order's line items, each representing a single product or service
              ordered.

              purchase order.

          other_custom_field1: A built-in custom field for additional information specific to this purchase
              order. Unlike the user-defined fields in the `customFields` array, this is a
              standard QuickBooks field that exists for all purchase orders for convenience.
              Developers often use this field for tracking information that doesn't fit into
              other standard QuickBooks fields. Hidden by default in the QuickBooks UI.

          other_custom_field2: A second built-in custom field for additional information specific to this
              purchase order. Unlike the user-defined fields in the `customFields` array, this

              Hidden by default in the QuickBooks UI.

          ref_number: The case-sensitive user-defined reference number for this purchase order, which
              can be used to identify the transaction in QuickBooks. This value is not
              required to be unique and can be arbitrarily changed by the QuickBooks user.

          sales_tax_code_id: The sales-tax code associated with this purchase order, determining whether
              items bought from this vendor are taxable or non-taxable. It's used to assign a
              default tax status to all transactions for this purchase order. Default codes
              include "Non" (non-taxable) and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes can also be
              created in QuickBooks. If QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales tax (via the
              "Do You Charge Sales Tax?" preference), it will assign the default non-taxable
              code to all sales.

              Use this parameter in conjunction with the `cursor` parameter to paginate
              through results. The response will include a `nextCursor` field, which can be
              used as the `cursor` parameter value in subsequent requests to fetch the next
              set of results.

          ref_number_contains: Filter for purchase orders whose `refNumber` contains this substring. NOTE: If
              you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberStartsWith` or
              `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_ends_with: Filter for purchase orders whose `refNumber` ends with this substring. NOTE: If
              you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberStartsWith`.

          ref_number_from: Filter for purchase orders whose `refNumber` is greater than or equal to this
              value. If omitted, the range will begin with the first number of the list. Uses
              a numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.

          ref_numbers: Filter for specific purchase orders by their ref-number(s), case-sensitive. In
              QuickBooks, ref-numbers are not required to be unique and can be arbitrarily
              changed by the QuickBooks user.

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          ref_number_starts_with:
              Filter for purchase orders whose `refNumber` starts with this substring. NOTE:
              If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_to: Filter for purchase orders whose `refNumber` is less than or equal to this
              value. If omitted, the range will end with the last number of the list. Uses a
              numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.

          transaction_date_from: Filter for purchase orders created on or after this date, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD).

          transaction_date_to: Filter for purchase orders created on or before this date, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD).

          updated_after: Filter for purchase orders updated on or after this date and time, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time
              is assumed to be 00:00:00 of that day.

          updated_before: Filter for purchase orders updated on or before this date and time, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time
              is assumed to be 23:59:59 of that day.

          vendor_ids: Filter for purchase orders sent to these vendors.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request

          timeout: Override the client-level default timeout for this request, in seconds
