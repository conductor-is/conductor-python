        Creates a new service item.

        Args:
          name: The case-insensitive name of this service item. Not guaranteed to be unique
              because it does not include the names of its hierarchical parent objects like
              `fullName` does. For example, two service items could both have the `name`
              "Web-Design", but they could have unique `fullName` values, such as
              "Consulting:Web-Design" and "Contracting:Web-Design". Maximum length: 31
              characters.

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          barcode: The service item's barcode.

          class_id: The service item's class. Classes can be used to categorize objects into
              meaningful segments, such as department, location, or type of work. In
              QuickBooks, class tracking is off by default.

          external_id: A globally unique identifier (GUID) you can provide for tracking this object in
              your external system.

              **IMPORTANT**: Must be formatted as a valid GUID; otherwise, QuickBooks will
              return an error. This field is immutable and can only be set during object
              creation.

          is_active: Indicates whether this service item is active. Inactive objects are typically
              hidden from views and reports in QuickBooks.

          parent_id: The parent service item one level above this one in the hierarchy. For example,
              if this service item has a `fullName` of "Consulting:Web-Design", its parent has
              a `fullName` of "Consulting". If this service item is at the top level, this
              field will be `null`.

          sales_and_purchase_details: Details for service items that are both purchased and sold, such as reimbursable
              expenses or inventory items that are bought from vendors and sold to customers.

              **IMPORTANT**: You must specify either `salesAndPurchaseDetails` or
              `salesOrPurchaseDetails` when creating a service item, but never both because an
              item cannot have both configurations.

          sales_or_purchase_details: Details for service items that are exclusively sold or exclusively purchased,
              but not both. This typically applies to non-inventory items (like a purchased
              office supply that isn't resold) or service items (like consulting services that
              are sold but not purchased).

              **IMPORTANT**: You must specify either `salesOrPurchaseDetails` or
              `salesAndPurchaseDetails` when creating a service item, but never both because
              an item cannot have both configurations.

          sales_tax_code_id: The sales-tax code associated with this service item, determining whether it is
              taxable or non-taxable. It's used to assign a default tax status to all
              transactions for this service item. Default codes include "Non" (non-taxable)
              and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes can also be created in QuickBooks. If
              QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales tax (via the "Do You Charge Sales Tax?"
              preference), it will assign the default non-taxable code to all sales.

          unit_of_measure_set_id: The unit-of-measure set associated with this service item, which consists of a
              base unit and related units.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

              you can get by fetching the object first. Provide the most recent
              `revisionNumber` to ensure you're working with the latest data; otherwise, the
              update will return an error.

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          barcode: The service item's barcode.

              QuickBooks, class tracking is off by default.

          force_unit_of_measure_change: Indicates whether to allow changing the service item's unit-of-measure set
              (using the `unitOfMeasureSetId` field) when the base unit of the new
              unit-of-measure set does not match that of the currently assigned set. Without
              setting this field to `true` in this scenario, the request will fail with an
              error; hence, this field is equivalent to accepting the warning prompt in the
              QuickBooks UI.

              NOTE: Changing the base unit requires you to update the item's
              quantities-on-hand and cost to reflect the new unit; otherwise, these values
              will be inaccurate. Alternatively, consider creating a new item with the desired
              unit-of-measure set and deactivating the old item.

          is_active: Indicates whether this service item is active. Inactive objects are typically
              hidden from views and reports in QuickBooks.

          name: The case-insensitive name of this service item. Not guaranteed to be unique
              because it does not include the names of its hierarchical parent objects like
              `fullName` does. For example, two service items could both have the `name`
              "Web-Design", but they could have unique `fullName` values, such as
              "Consulting:Web-Design" and "Contracting:Web-Design". Maximum length: 31

          parent_id: The parent service item one level above this one in the hierarchy. For example,
              if this service item has a `fullName` of "Consulting:Web-Design", its parent has
              a `fullName` of "Consulting". If this service item is at the top level, this
              field will be `null`.

          sales_and_purchase_details: Details for service items that are both purchased and sold, such as reimbursable
              expenses or inventory items that are bought from vendors and sold to customers.

              **IMPORTANT**: You cannot specify both `salesAndPurchaseDetails` and
              `salesOrPurchaseDetails` when modifying a service item because an item cannot
              have both configurations.

          sales_or_purchase_details: Details for service items that are exclusively sold or exclusively purchased,
              but not both. This typically applies to non-inventory items (like a purchased
              office supply that isn't resold) or service items (like consulting services that

              previous response. If omitted, the API returns the first page of results.

          full_names: Filter for specific service items by their full-name(s), case-insensitive. Like
              `id`, `fullName` is a unique identifier for a service item, formed by by
              combining the names of its parent objects with its own `name`, separated by

        Creates a new service item.

        Args:
          name: The case-insensitive name of this service item. Not guaranteed to be unique
              because it does not include the names of its hierarchical parent objects like
              `fullName` does. For example, two service items could both have the `name`
              "Web-Design", but they could have unique `fullName` values, such as
              "Consulting:Web-Design" and "Contracting:Web-Design". Maximum length: 31
              characters.

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          barcode: The service item's barcode.

          class_id: The service item's class. Classes can be used to categorize objects into
              meaningful segments, such as department, location, or type of work. In
              QuickBooks, class tracking is off by default.

          external_id: A globally unique identifier (GUID) you can provide for tracking this object in
              your external system.

              **IMPORTANT**: Must be formatted as a valid GUID; otherwise, QuickBooks will
              return an error. This field is immutable and can only be set during object
              creation.

          is_active: Indicates whether this service item is active. Inactive objects are typically
              hidden from views and reports in QuickBooks.

          parent_id: The parent service item one level above this one in the hierarchy. For example,
              if this service item has a `fullName` of "Consulting:Web-Design", its parent has
              a `fullName` of "Consulting". If this service item is at the top level, this
              field will be `null`.

          sales_and_purchase_details: Details for service items that are both purchased and sold, such as reimbursable
              expenses or inventory items that are bought from vendors and sold to customers.

              **IMPORTANT**: You must specify either `salesAndPurchaseDetails` or
              `salesOrPurchaseDetails` when creating a service item, but never both because an
              item cannot have both configurations.

          sales_or_purchase_details: Details for service items that are exclusively sold or exclusively purchased,
              but not both. This typically applies to non-inventory items (like a purchased
              office supply that isn't resold) or service items (like consulting services that
              are sold but not purchased).

              **IMPORTANT**: You must specify either `salesOrPurchaseDetails` or
              `salesAndPurchaseDetails` when creating a service item, but never both because
              an item cannot have both configurations.

          sales_tax_code_id: The sales-tax code associated with this service item, determining whether it is
              taxable or non-taxable. It's used to assign a default tax status to all
              transactions for this service item. Default codes include "Non" (non-taxable)
              and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes can also be created in QuickBooks. If
              QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales tax (via the "Do You Charge Sales Tax?"
              preference), it will assign the default non-taxable code to all sales.

          unit_of_measure_set_id: The unit-of-measure set associated with this service item, which consists of a
              base unit and related units.

          force_unit_of_measure_change: Indicates whether to allow changing the service item's unit-of-measure set
              (using the `unitOfMeasureSetId` field) when the base unit of the new
              unit-of-measure set does not match that of the currently assigned set. Without

              NOTE: Changing the base unit requires you to update the item's
              quantities-on-hand and cost to reflect the new unit; otherwise, these values
              will be inaccurate. Alternatively, consider creating a new item with the desired
              unit-of-measure set and deactivating the old item.

          is_active: Indicates whether this service item is active. Inactive objects are typically
              hidden from views and reports in QuickBooks.

          name: The case-insensitive name of this service item. Not guaranteed to be unique
              because it does not include the names of its hierarchical parent objects like

          sales_and_purchase_details: Details for service items that are both purchased and sold, such as reimbursable
              expenses or inventory items that are bought from vendors and sold to customers.

              **IMPORTANT**: You cannot specify both `salesAndPurchaseDetails` and
              `salesOrPurchaseDetails` when modifying a service item because an item cannot
              have both configurations.

          sales_or_purchase_details: Details for service items that are exclusively sold or exclusively purchased,
              but not both. This typically applies to non-inventory items (like a purchased
              office supply that isn't resold) or service items (like consulting services that

              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          class_ids: Filter for service items of these classes. A class is a way end-users can
              categorize service items in QuickBooks.

          cursor: The pagination token to fetch the next set of results when paginating with the
              `limit` parameter. Retrieve this value from the `nextCursor` field in the
              previous response. If omitted, the API returns the first page of results.

          full_names: Filter for specific service items by their full-name(s), case-insensitive. Like
              `id`, `fullName` is a unique identifier for a service item, formed by by
              combining the names of its parent objects with its own `name`, separated by
              colons. For example, if a service item is under "Consulting" and has the `name`
              "Web-Design", its `fullName` would be "Consulting:Web-Design".

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          ids: Filter for specific service items by their QuickBooks-assigned unique
              identifier(s).

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return. Ranging from 1 to 150, defaults to 150.
              Use this parameter in conjunction with the `cursor` parameter to paginate
              through results. The response will include a `nextCursor` field, which can be
              used as the `cursor` parameter value in subsequent requests to fetch the next
              set of results.

          name_contains: Filter for service items whose `name` contains this substring, case-insensitive.
              NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameStartsWith` or
              `nameEndsWith`.

          name_ends_with: Filter for service items whose `name` ends with this substring,
              case-insensitive. NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use
              `nameContains` or `nameStartsWith`.

          name_from: Filter for service items whose `name` is alphabetically greater than or equal to
              this value.

          name_starts_with: Filter for service items whose `name` starts with this substring,
              case-insensitive. NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use
              `nameContains` or `nameEndsWith`.

          name_to: Filter for service items whose `name` is alphabetically less than or equal to
              this value.

          status: Filter for service items that are active, inactive, or both.

          updated_after: Filter for service items updated on or after this date and time, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time
              is assumed to be 00:00:00 of that day.

          updated_before: Filter for service items updated on or before this date and time, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time
              is assumed to be 23:59:59 of that day.

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request
