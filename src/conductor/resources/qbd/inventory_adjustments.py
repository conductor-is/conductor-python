        NOTE: QuickBooks Desktop does not
        support pagination for inventory adjustments; hence, there is no `cursor`
        parameter. Users typically have few inventory adjustments.

        Args:
          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          account_ids: Filter for inventory adjustments associated with these accounts.

          customer_ids: Filter for inventory adjustments associated with these customers.

          ids: Filter for specific inventory adjustments by their QuickBooks-assigned unique
              identifier(s).

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          include_line_items: Whether to include line items in the response. Defaults to `true`.

          item_ids: Filter for inventory adjustments containing these inventory items.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return.

              **IMPORTANT**: QuickBooks Desktop does not support cursor-based pagination for
              inventory adjustments. This parameter will limit the response size, but you
              cannot fetch subsequent results using a cursor. For pagination, use the
              name-range parameters instead (e.g., `nameFrom=A&nameTo=B`).

              When this parameter is omitted, the endpoint returns all inventory adjustments
              without limit, unlike paginated endpoints which default to 150 records. This is
              acceptable because inventory adjustments typically have low record counts.

          ref_number_contains: Filter for inventory adjustments whose `refNumber` contains this substring.
              NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberStartsWith` or
              `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_ends_with: Filter for inventory adjustments whose `refNumber` ends with this substring.
              NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberStartsWith`.

          ref_number_from: Filter for inventory adjustments whose `refNumber` is greater than or equal to
              this value. If omitted, the range will begin with the first number of the list.
              Uses a numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses
              a lexicographical comparison.

          ref_numbers: Filter for specific inventory adjustments by their ref-number(s),
              case-sensitive. In QuickBooks, ref-numbers are not required to be unique and can
              be arbitrarily changed by the QuickBooks user.

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          ref_number_starts_with: Filter for inventory adjustments whose `refNumber` starts with this substring.
              NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_to: Filter for inventory adjustments whose `refNumber` is less than or equal to this
              value. If omitted, the range will end with the last number of the list. Uses a
              numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.

          transaction_date_from: Filter for inventory adjustments created on or after this date, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          transaction_date_to: Filter for inventory adjustments created on or before this date, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          updated_after: Filter for inventory adjustments updated on or after this date and time, in ISO
              8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the
              time is assumed to be 00:00:00 of that day.

          updated_before: Filter for inventory adjustments updated on or before this date and time, in ISO
              8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the

        parameter. Users typically have few inventory adjustments.

        Args:
          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          account_ids: Filter for inventory adjustments associated with these accounts.

          customer_ids: Filter for inventory adjustments associated with these customers.

          ids: Filter for specific inventory adjustments by their QuickBooks-assigned unique
              identifier(s).

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          include_line_items: Whether to include line items in the response. Defaults to `true`.

          item_ids: Filter for inventory adjustments containing these inventory items.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return.

              **IMPORTANT**: QuickBooks Desktop does not support cursor-based pagination for
              inventory adjustments. This parameter will limit the response size, but you
              cannot fetch subsequent results using a cursor. For pagination, use the
              name-range parameters instead (e.g., `nameFrom=A&nameTo=B`).

              When this parameter is omitted, the endpoint returns all inventory adjustments
              without limit, unlike paginated endpoints which default to 150 records. This is
              acceptable because inventory adjustments typically have low record counts.

          ref_number_contains: Filter for inventory adjustments whose `refNumber` contains this substring.
              NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberStartsWith` or
              `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_ends_with: Filter for inventory adjustments whose `refNumber` ends with this substring.
              NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberStartsWith`.

          ref_number_from: Filter for inventory adjustments whose `refNumber` is greater than or equal to
              this value. If omitted, the range will begin with the first number of the list.
              Uses a numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses
              a lexicographical comparison.

          ref_numbers: Filter for specific inventory adjustments by their ref-number(s),
              case-sensitive. In QuickBooks, ref-numbers are not required to be unique and can
              be arbitrarily changed by the QuickBooks user.

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          ref_number_starts_with: Filter for inventory adjustments whose `refNumber` starts with this substring.
              NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_to: Filter for inventory adjustments whose `refNumber` is less than or equal to this
              value. If omitted, the range will end with the last number of the list. Uses a
              numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.

          transaction_date_from: Filter for inventory adjustments created on or after this date, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          transaction_date_to: Filter for inventory adjustments created on or before this date, in ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          updated_after: Filter for inventory adjustments updated on or after this date and time, in ISO
              8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the
              time is assumed to be 00:00:00 of that day.
