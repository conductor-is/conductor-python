              otherwise, the update will return an error.

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,

        Use the `cursor` parameter to paginate through the
        results.

        Args:
          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          cursor: The pagination token to fetch the next set of results when paginating with the
              `limit` parameter. Retrieve this value from the `nextCursor` field in the
              previous response. If omitted, the API returns the first page of results.

          ids: Filter for specific employees by their QuickBooks-assigned unique identifier(s).

              **IMPORTANT:**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return. Accepts values ranging from 1 to 150,
              defaults to 150. When used with cursor-based pagination, this parameter controls
              how many results are returned per page. To paginate through results, combine
              this with the `cursor` parameter. Each response will include a `nextCursor`
              value that can be passed to subsequent requests to retrieve the next page of
              results.

          name_contains: Filter for employees whose `name` contains this substring, case-insensitive.
              NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameStartsWith` or
              `nameEndsWith`.

          name_ends_with: Filter for employees whose `name` ends with this substring, case-insensitive.
              NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameContains` or
              `nameStartsWith`.

          name_from: Filter for employees whose `name` is alphabetically greater than or equal to
              this value.

          names: Filter for specific employees by their name(s), case-insensitive. Like `id`,
              `name` is a unique identifier for an employee.

              **IMPORTANT:**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          name_starts_with: Filter for employees whose `name` starts with this substring, case-insensitive.
              NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameContains` or
              `nameEndsWith`.

          name_to: Filter for employees whose `name` is alphabetically less than or equal to this
              value.

          status: Filter for employees that are active, inactive, or both.

          updated_after: Filter for employees updated on or after this date and time, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time is
              assumed to be 00:00:00 of that day.

          updated_before: Filter for employees updated on or before this date and time, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time is

        """Returns a list of employees.

        Use the `cursor` parameter to paginate through the
        results.

        Args:
          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          cursor: The pagination token to fetch the next set of results when paginating with the
              `limit` parameter. Retrieve this value from the `nextCursor` field in the
              previous response. If omitted, the API returns the first page of results.

          ids: Filter for specific employees by their QuickBooks-assigned unique identifier(s).

              **IMPORTANT:**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return. Accepts values ranging from 1 to 150,
              defaults to 150. When used with cursor-based pagination, this parameter controls
              how many results are returned per page. To paginate through results, combine
              this with the `cursor` parameter. Each response will include a `nextCursor`
              value that can be passed to subsequent requests to retrieve the next page of
              results.

          name_contains: Filter for employees whose `name` contains this substring, case-insensitive.
              NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameStartsWith` or
              `nameEndsWith`.

          name_ends_with: Filter for employees whose `name` ends with this substring, case-insensitive.
              NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameContains` or
              `nameStartsWith`.

          name_from: Filter for employees whose `name` is alphabetically greater than or equal to
              this value.

          names: Filter for specific employees by their name(s), case-insensitive. Like `id`,
              `name` is a unique identifier for an employee.

              **IMPORTANT:**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

          name_starts_with: Filter for employees whose `name` starts with this substring, case-insensitive.
              NOTE: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameContains` or
              `nameEndsWith`.

          name_to: Filter for employees whose `name` is alphabetically less than or equal to this
              value.

          status: Filter for employees that are active, inactive, or both.

          updated_after: Filter for employees updated on or after this date and time, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time is
              assumed to be 00:00:00 of that day.

          updated_before: Filter for employees updated on or before this date and time, in ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss). If you only provide a date (YYYY-MM-DD), the time is
              assumed to be 23:59:59 of that day.
